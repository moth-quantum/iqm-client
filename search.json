    "content": "Quantum gates are represented by QuantumOp data classes, containing the required\nmetadata to define the gate. A QuantumOp is identified by its name , and arity defines number of locus components the operation acts on. For example,\nthe PRX operation (Phased X Rotation) is a single-qubit operation, so its arity is 1, whereas the CZ (Controlled-Z) gate\nacts on two qubits, having arity 2. Arity 0 has a special meaning that the operation in question can act on any number\nof components (for example Barrier ). The attribute symmetric defines whether the effect of the quantum operation\nis symmetric with respect to changing the order of its locus components. As an example, the CZ gate is a symmetric\ntwo-qubit gate, whereas CNOT (Controlled-NOT) is not symmetric. Some quantum operations are defined as \u201cfunctions\u201d, taking one or more parameters to define the effect. These\narguments are stored in the attribute params . As an example, the PRX gate\ntakes two arguments, angle (the rotation angle with respect to the z-axis of the Bloch sphere), and phase (the rotation phase in the rotating frame). On the other hand, many operations do not require any parameters, in\nwhich case this field is an empty tuple (e.g. the CZ gate). A QuantumOp has unambiguous definition in terms of its intended effect on the computational subspace of the\nQPU component, but it can be implemented in various ways. Each implementation is represented as a GateImplementation subclass. A QuantumOp stores its known implementations in the\nfield implementations . Note that even though QuantumOp is a frozen data class, the implementations dictionary can be modified, e.g.\nto add new implementations or to change their order (usually programmatically by some client procedure, but nothing as\nsuch prevents the user from manipulating the contents manually). The default implementation is how the user prefers\nto implement the operation unless otherwise specified (in effect, this is what will get called in most cases the\noperation is invoked). In the implementations dict, the default implementation is defined as the first entry.\nQuantumOp contains helpful methods that allow setting and returning the default implementation for specific cases: set_default_implementation() , get_default_implementation_for_locus() , and set_default_implementation_for_locus() . The attribute unitary stores a function that can be used to get the unitary\nmatrix representing the quantum operation in question. The unitary function must have the same arguments\nas defined in params , such that for each collection of these parameters it\ngives the associated unitary matrix. Note that not all QuantumOps necessarily even represent a unitary gate (e.g.\nthe measure operation is not one), or the exact form of the unitary matrix might not be known. In these cases, the\nfield can be left None . The unitary does not need to be defined for most of the basic usage of a QuantumOp, but certain\nalgorithmic methods (e.g. some implementations of Randomized Benchmarking) may require the unitary matrices to be known,\nand such operations that do not define the getter function cannot then be used in these contexts. For more information, see the API docs of QuantumOp for the full list of fields needed\nto define a quantum operation and the available class methods. While QuantumOp represents an abstract quantum operation, its implementations contain\nthe concrete logic of how to make that operation happen using QC hardware. Gate implementations are subclasses of GateImplementation . In this section, the main features of that class are\nintroduced (for a full list of class methods see the API docs), with the emphasis being on how to create your own\ngate implementations. Starting with __init__() , it is important to note that the init\nmethods of all gate implementations must have the exact same signature: Here, parent is the QuantumOp this gate implementation implements, and name is the implementation\u2019s name in\nthe dictionary implementations . locus is the set of (usually logical) components\nthe QuantumOp acts on (the size of the locus must be consistent with the parent \u2019s arity ), while calibration_data gives the required calibration data values\nfor this implementation and locus (can be empty in case the implementation needs no calibration data). Finally,\nThe implementations store a reference to the ScheduleBuilder that created it. This is\nbecause GateImplementations are practically never created manually by calling the init method itself. Instead, one\nneeds a builder and uses get_implementation() . The responsibility of the init method is to (at least) store the calibration_data provided from the builder for\nfurther use, but in many cases, one might want to create some intermediate objects like pulses or instructions from that calibration data already at this point. Note that ScheduleBuilder caches its GateImplementations per each locus and calibration_data , so as long as the calibration is not changed, the code in init will be called just once per locus. GateImplementations are Callables, i.e. they implement the __call__ method. It should take as its arguments at least\nthe QuantumOpt parameters defined for the parent in params , but in\naddition it may have optional extra arguments. The call method should return a TimeBox object\nthat contains the pulses, instructions and other logic required to implement the quantum operation in question. The\ntypical usage of gate implementations then looks like this (See Using ScheduleBuilder and Pulse timing for more\ninfo on scheduling and the ScheduleBuilder): The base class __call__() method does automatic TimeBox caching based\non the unique values of the call arguments, and in many cases, one does not want to reimplement this caching in their own\nimplementations. For this reason, there is the method _call which contains just the pure TimeBox creation logic.\nDevelopers can choose to override that instead of __call__ in cases where the call args are hashable python types,\nand then they can utilize the default caching of TimeBoxes from the base class. When writing a GateImplementation, a developer should consider what parts of the logic should go to the class init and\nwhat to the __call__ or _call method. A general rule of thumb would be that any parts that can be precomputed\nand do not depend on the call arguments can go to init, and the rest to call. As an example, let\u2019s go through a simple PRX _call method (note that the default PRX implementations do not\nuse this exact call method, as this is a simplified example for educational purposes): Here, we first create an IQPulse object which is a low-level Instruction. IQPulse\nmeans a \u201ccomplex pulse\u201d which has two orthogonal components i and q \u2013 this what drive pulses look like in general. In\nthis simplified example, we have hardcoded the pulse waveforms into TruncatedGaussian and TruncatedGaussianDerivative for the i and q components, respectively (this is a DRAG implementation, so the\nq component is the derivative of the i component). The waveforms are parametrized by the calibration_data for the\ngiven locus (see the next subsection for more info on Waveforms and calibration data). The PRX QuantumOp param angle scales the pulse amplitude linearly (the waveforms are normalized to one), and the param phase defines relative\nphase modulation. Then the returned TimeBox is created out of the instruction . Note that\nsince we override _call here, instead of __call__ , so this implementation would utilize the default base class\ncaching such that the TimeBoxes are cached per unique values of (angle, phase) . Another important concept is a the so called locus mapping of a gate implementation. Locus mappings define on which\nloci, i.e. groups of components, a given implementation can be defined. They are used to relay the information which\nloci are supported to a client application (e.g. EXA). In addition, the gate implementation itself can programmatically\nuse this information self.builder.chip_topology . For example, a PRX can be defined on all single components that are connected to a drive line, and CZ can be defined on\nconnected pairs of qubits. Locus mappings live in ScheduleBuilder.chip_topology which is a ChipTopology object. Locus mapping is a dict whose keys are the loci\n( tuple[str, ...] keys denote asymmetric loci where the order of the components matter, and frozenset[str] type\nloci denote symmetric ones), and the values are groups of components, typed tuple[str, ...] , where each locus can be\nmapped with some additional components that are needed for the operation of the implementation. For example, some CZ\nimplementation that tries to correct for crosstalk could map the non-locus components that see this crosstalk here.\nThe values of the dict can be left empty or just replicate the key components in case such extra information is not\nneeded. GateImplementations can define their locus mappings via get_custom_locus_mapping() or if a client application already\nadds the mapping, we can just return its name via get_locus_mapping_name() .\nIf neither of these methods are overridden in a GateImplementation class, the default behaviour will be such that an arity==1 loci will be assumed to use the mapping where all single qubits are the keys, and arity==2 loci the\n(symmetric) mapping where the keys are all pairs of connected qubits. For other arities there is no default behaviour,\nso it is then mandatory to define the mapping explicitly using the aforementioned methods. In order to implement most QuantumOps, one has to physically alter the state of the QPU. This is typically done by playing\nspecified and correctly calibrated pulses via the control electronics (this applies to all typical logical gates such as\ne.g. PRX or CZ \u2013 non-physcial metaoperations such as Barrier are an exception). In defining these pulses, there are two\nlevels of abstractions: Waveform and Instruction . Waveform represents the physical form of the control pulse, typically normalized to the interval [-1.0, 1.0] . The\nEach Waveform subclass can define any number of waveform parameters as class\nattributes, which can be used to programmatically define the waveform. For example, a Gaussian could be defined in terms\nof the average mu and spread sigma . A Waveform class then essentially contains just the parameters\nand a recipe for computing the samples as an np.ndarray . As an example, here is how one writes the Waveform class\nfor Gaussian : The Instructions RealPulse and IQPulse allow handling the amplitudes (via the attribute scale ) without\nhaving to resample the waveform for every different amplitude value. However, one can always choose to include\nthe amplitude into the sampling and then use scale=1 . The waveform parameters (like sigma in the above Gaussian) typically require calibration when the Waveform is used\nin a quantum gate. However, the GateImplementation usually has other calibrated parameters as well defined in the\nimplementation itself. As an example, here are the implementation-level parameters of the default PRX implementation,\ndefined as class attribute: Note the amplitudes are defined here on this level, since the default PRX uses normalized Waveforms and factors in the\namplitudes via scale . In these parameters, the unit is not just metadata. The control electronics understand time\nin terms of samples and their sample rate, while human users typically want to input seconds instead of doing the sample\nconversion manually. For this reason, there is logic that converts anything that has the unit \"s\" into samples.\nSimilarly, parameters with \"Hz\" units are converted to 1/sample . For the Waveform parameters, the same logic\napplies, but by default it is assumed that all parameters are time-like and this converted from seconds to samples.\nIf some Waveform parameters needs to be made unitless or e.g. frequency-like (with \"Hz\" units), it can be achieved\nwith the method non_timelike_attributes() : In the above dict, the keys should be the attribute names and values their units. To make creating new GateImplementations more comfortable, there are additional base classes on top of GateImplementation itself. CompositeGate allows quick implementation of gates in terms of other gates,\nusing a similar syntax as with creating/scheduling several TimeBoxes together (see Using ScheduleBuilder ). At it\nsimplest, a ComposteGate is just the _call method: Here, one could use also builder.get_implementation instead of build() , but the latter allows calibrating the member gates\ncase specifically for this composite if they are first registered via registered_gates (in this case, there is\njust one member, PRX). Creating new implementations for the PRX, CZ and Measure gates often means just coming up with new waveforms for the\ncontrol pulses. If this is the case, there are helpful base classes that make those implementations into oneliners\n(outside of defining the Waveforms themselves): PRX_CustomWaveforms , FluxPulseGate , and Measure_CustomWaveforms . Using these\nbase classes at its simplest looks like this: All of these classes automatically include the associated Waveform parameters into the calibration parameters of\nthe implementation itself. There is also a general base class for any gate that implements a single IQPulse (both PRX_CustomWaveForms and Measure_MyCoolWaveforms actually inherit from it), regardless of the context: CustomIQWaveforms . Gate definitions (i.e. QuantumOps) are stored in ScheduleBuilder \u2019s attribute op_table . When the builder is created, the op_table comes preloaded with the all the basic QuantumOps needed for\ntypical circuit execution and their default implementations. These include e.g. the PRX gate, the CZ gate, the measure\noperation, the conditional prx operation, the reset operation, and the barrier operation. In order to add custom operations, there is a helpful function register_implementation() that\nin addition to adding new implementations allows one to add altogether new quantum operations. As an example here is a snippet that adds the CNOT gate, and its implementation, into an existing builder: Here, the CNOT implementation MyCNotClass needs to be of course defined first (a QuantumOp always needs at least one\nimplementation). Note that often ScheduleBuilder is created and operated by some client application, and the same application usually\nhas its own interface for adding/manipulating QuantumOps. However, if the user has access to the builder object, the\nabove method will always work. previous Using ScheduleBuilder next Pulse timing \u00a9 Copyright 2019-2025, IQM Finland Oy.

    "content": "This section gives an overview of the main concepts and terminology in IQM Pulse. QPUs contain components : qubits, computational resonators, couplers, and probelines. Each component may have some control channels connected to it. Control channels deliver physical control pulses\nto the QPU. Quantum operations have a locus , which is the set of quantum information carrying components\n(qubits and resonators) the operation acts on.\nOne operation may involve sending pulses to multiple control channels. The assembly of a Playlist, or a batch of quantum circuits, can be summarized as follows: A Playlist contains multiple independent segments , to be executed as a batch. A segment is a conceptual unit at a time scale where the quantum information of the QPU can be\nassumed to be preserved. A quantum circuit corresponds to one segment. What is executed during a segment is determined by a Schedule . A Schedule is a set of hardware control channels, each with a strictly timed sequence of Instructions . A Schedule is formed by scheduling a Timebox . A TimeBox can contain other TimeBoxes without precise relative timing,\nor it can be atomic, in which case it contains a single Schedule . The image below illustrates how a Playlist of two segments is formed from TimeBoxes. Hardware instructions are the lowest-level construct visible on the client side.\nInstructions are a set of atomic, real-time execution commands for the control hardware supported by IQM.\nThey work in a time scale where the quantum information of the QPU can be assumed to be preserved.\nExamples of Instructions are IQPulse to play a microwave pulse on a channel, VirtualRZ to adjust the modulation phase, ReadoutTrigger to acquire measurement data,\nand Wait to delay the next Instruction for a given time.\nSee iqm.pulse.playlist.instructions for the complete list. During execution, each hardware control channel executes its own sequence of Instructions.\nEach Instruction blocks the next until it is completed.\nInstructions are as explicit as possible, so that there is no ambiguity on what will be executed when.\nIQM Station control transforms Instructions to machine-specific commands. All Instructions have a duration, measured in samples, though the duration can be zero.\nThe durations are subject to hardware-specific granularity constraints.\nFor example, some hardware might require all instructions to be a multiple of 16 samples long, with a minimum of 32.\nInstructions violating the granularity constraints will raise an error.\nHowever, a typical user does not need to concern themselves about the constraints, as\nthe gate implementations and IQM Pulse\u2019s scheduling ensures the constraints are respected.\nThe philosophy is that Station Control, which is inaccessible to the user, does not attempt to do any smart\n\u201cmagic\u201d to fix inconsistencies in the user\u2019s input, it simply executes the Playlist it is given.\nInstead, the magic happens on the client side so that it is transparent to the user. Note For technical reasons, IQM Pulse mostly uses classes from iqm.pulse.playlist.instructions , but when\nfinalizing the output, the instructions are converted to iqm.models.playlist.instructions .\nThese two class families are semantically equivalent, apart from a few exceptions like Block which\nonly exists on the client side to help with scheduling. Schedule contains a number of control channels, each with a lists of Instructions.\nAll channels in a Schedule start executing at the same instant, and the timing is defined by the duration of the\nindividual Instructions.\nSchedules can be thought of as a fixed block that occupies some interval on a timeline of some channels. Schedules appear in two contexts: gate implementations and as complete segments.\nFor example, when an implementation of a PRX gate is requested,\na small Schedule involving the drive channel of a single qubit is created.\nWhen all the desired gates in a circuit have been scheduled by concatenating the gate-schedules together,\nthe end result, a segment, is a large Schedule occupying all necessary channels.\nA typical segment starts with initializing the qubits and ends with reading out their state. Whereas a Schedule is a container with strict relative timing, a TimeBox is a container with undefined\nrelative timing.\nEach TimeBox can be labeled using a human-readable label describing it, and operates on a number\nof locus components , using some of their control channels.\nA composite TimeBox contains other TimeBoxes as children, whereas atomic TimeBoxes contain a Schedule. TimeBoxes are the main language in which users define the order and relative alignment of execution elements, be it\ngates, Schedules, or larger TimeBoxes. A key process is the scheduling, in which TimeBoxes are resolved recursively into a fixed Schedule.\nWhen resolving, all Schedules inside the TimeBox are concatenated and are either left-aligned (ASAP) or right-aligned\n(ALAP), respecting the hardware constraints.\nImportantly, if some TimeBoxes have content on disjoint channels, the Schedules are allowed to happen simultaneously.\nIf they have content on partly overlapping channels, the Schedules are concatenated while preserving their internal\ntiming.\nAny interval that does not have explicit instructions is filled with Wait Instructions.\nThe figure above demonstrates how TimeBoxes are resolved. The syntax and rules are explained in more detail in Using ScheduleBuilder . A higher-level concept, a QuantumOp can represent a unitary quantum gate,\nor for example a measurement operation (not all QuantumOps necessarily represent a unitary gate).\nQuantumOps are simple, abstract, self-contained actions one can execute on a station as parts of a quantum circuit.\nThey include quantum gates like PRX, CZ, and measurements and resets.\nWhereas Schedules and Instructions act on control channels, QuantumOps act on named components on the QPU, such as\nqubits or computational resonators. A QuantumOp has unambiguous definition in terms of its intended effect on the computational subspace of the\nQPU component, but it can be implemented in various ways.\nEach implementation is represented as a GateImplementation. The list of available QuantumOps at runtime can be obtained with iqm.pulse.builder.build_quantum_ops() .\nA new QuantumOp can be registered at runtime, together with an implementation, with iqm.pulse.gates.register_implementation() . A GateImplementation bridges the gap between QuantumOps and TimeBoxes.\nWhen a user requests a QuantumOp from ScheduleBuilder with specific parameters and locus components, the\nchosen GateImplementation (usually the default) for the operation is used to produce a TimeBox.\nThis TimeBox, usually atomic, contains a Schedule on the appropriate control channels.\nThe Instructions within are constructed following the calibration values from the ScheduleBuilder. All gate implementations are listed in iqm.pulse.gates .\nSection Custom gate implementations explains how to add more implementations. Once all TimeBoxes are scheduled into large Schedules, one for each segment/circuit,\nthe Schedules are collected into a Playlist .\nThe Playlist is the final product that is sent to Station Control.\nIts contents are compressed by indexing all unique Instructions and waveforms on each channel,\nand representing the control channels in each segment as lists of Instruction indices. During execution, the segments in the Playlist are executed in order, and the whole sequence is repeated\na number of times equal to the number of repetitions (shots). Segments are separated in time by end delay , a parameter outside the Playlist.\nA long end delay can be used to prevent quantum information carrying from one segment to the next,\nthus resetting the qubits.\nAlternatively, the reset can be encoded in each segment as a long Wait instruction or using some active reset scheme. Station Control aims to execute all segments together, but sometimes this is not possible due to various memory\nconstraints.\nIn case the whole Playlist does not fit in memory, the segments are split into chunks which are executed separately.\nThe delay between chunks is undefined.\nTherefore, the time between segments is guaranteed to be at least the duration of the end delay, but can be much larger. inspect_playlist() provides a neat visual representation of the playlist, as blocks of instructions on a\ntimeline. previous IQM Pulse next Using ScheduleBuilder \u00a9 Copyright 2019-2025, IQM Finland Oy.

    "content": "The ReadoutTrigger Instruction responsible of qubit readout has several\ntiming-related attributes.\nThe measure.constant gate implementation produces the lower-level ReadoutTrigger instruction\nfrom a simplified set of settings.\nThe figure below shows how the settings relate to the more flexible attributes of the instruction. With conditional Instructions, we specify how the information from readout operations should affect Instructions at\nruntime.\nUsually, the goal is use the information as soon as possible, but it takes a finite time to propagate from the\nacquisition unit to the drive channels that execute the Instructions conditionally. Note On all hardware supported by IQM QCCSW, ConditionalInstruction reads the signal bit at the time of\nexcution, regardless of when the signal bit was last updated.\nThis means that if the Conditionalinstruction is executed too early, the condition will be executed based on the\nprevious state of the bit. To facilitate efficient timing of the feedback signals, IQM Pulse uses virtual channels between probeline channels\n(the source of the signals) and drive channels (the destinations).\nBlock instructions on the virtual channel represent the travel time of the signals. CCPRX_Composite is GateImplementation of the cc_prx (classically controlled PRX) that outputs two\nTimeBoxes:\nthe first one to represent the travel time, and the second one with the actual ConditionalInstruction .\nIn typical use, both should be scheduled in the same order, to ensure the Conditionalinstrucion starts when the\nsignal bit is available. The following image illustrates how the TimeBoxes are used for qubits QB2 and QB3 .\nFor QB2, this is also how Reset_Conditional implements the reset operation. The equaivalent code would be Instructions are spaced out in time only for visual clarity. When scheduled ASAP, they would be left-aligned\nsuch that the ConditionalInstructions start right after the associated control_delay has passed. The bottom of the image illustrates an alternative use of CCPRX_Composite to have more freedom in the timing.\nThere, the optional delay TimeBox is not used for scheduling the Instructions on QB4.\nInstead, the user has ensured that the other instructions take enough time for the signal to arrive.\nThis could be used to act on the previous feedback signal (not shown). Note This section is not about IQM Pulse itself, but might help in understanding the details of the execution. The image below shows a typical timing of a Playlist segment with 2 AWG devices for driving, and a readout instrument.\nHere, all statements that apply to an AWG apply to readout instruments as well.\nThe AWGs can output an arbitrary sequence of pulses, and the readout instrument can additionally read out\nthe response to the pulses. With readout, the raw signal response from the readout pulse will be integrated to produce a single number, such as a\ncomplex number or a bit, corresponding to a particular qubit in a particular segment. In the figure, one of the AWGs has been selected as the trigger master, which means it sends trigger pulses to\nstart the execution on the slave devices.\nAs shown in the picture, different delays caused by the travel time of signals can be compensated for by\nadjusting the trigger_delay setting of each device. Settings in the figure that can be adjusted by user in the higher level libraries: Setting Explanation <awg>.trigger_delay Wait time between the end of the trigger signal of the AWG master and the beginning of the pulse sequence. <awg>.trigger_delay (slave) Wait time between receiving the trigger signal at the AWG slave and the beginning of the pulse sequence. options.end_delay Wait time between the end of the pulse segment and the next trigger. <gate>.<implementation>.<locus>.duration The duration of the hardware instruction for a gate, possibly rounded to satisfy granularity constraints.\nFor the ReadoutTrigger instruction, the meaning is different, see below. Other notes: The AWG spcecified by options.trigger_master is the only channel that does not wait for a trigger\nat the start of a segment. Slave AWGs may also emit a trigger pulse to allow daisy chaining trigger signals. Systems with IQM Control System are triggered centrally and the channels run independently, and the options.trigger_master has no effect. Pipeline delays are delays between the execution of a command and the pulse actually getting outputted\nfrom a device. This delay is caused by the hardware and cannot be changed.\nIn practice, it can be thought as being part of the cable delays, and thus can be compensated with trigger_delay setting. previous Custom gate implementations next API Reference \u00a9 Copyright 2019-2025, IQM Finland Oy.

    "content": "This section describes how to use ScheduleBuilder to compose pulse schedules.\nScheduleBuilder encapsulates registered QuantumOps, the calibration information for them, QPU components and their\ntopology, and control channel properties. In the context of IQM Pulla and EXA, an instance of ScheduleBuilder is given by the framework,\nand it contains all the necessary information to execute against a particular quantum computer instance.\nHere, we assume that user has an instance of ScheduleBuilder builder to work with. A typical workflow begins with calling get_implementation() with the name of a desired QuantumOp and the locus\nfor the operation.\nThe locus is the logical target of the operation, usually a sequence of qubits or computational resonators.\nThis outputs a an instance of GateImplementation , which is capable of producing TimeBoxes with the correct\ncalibration for that locus. For example, here we ask for the GateImplementation of prx , cz , and measure , all of which are standard\ngates recognized by IQM Pulse, for qubits QB1 and QB3 .\nAny gate which is registered in the runtime can be requested this way. Notice how the number of qubits matches the operation: CZ acts on 2 qubits, while PRX acts on only one.\nMeasure can act on any number of qubits. There might be several available implementations for an operation. get_implementation gives the implementation that is set as the default, unless a specific implementation is\nrequested with a keyword argument. To instantiate some concrete TimeBoxes, we call time implementation with the logical parameters of the operations, as\ndefined by the QuantumOps.\nPRX has 2 parameters: the 2 angles of a phased rotation.\nCZ does not have any parameters. One important method is the wait() , which blocks the control channels of the given components for a certain time: In all of the examples above, the TimeBoxes are atomic, which can be organized into composite TimeBoxes to decide\ntheir relative order. TimeBoxes can be concatenated with the following rules: Addition ( + ) concatenates the children of the operands into a single TimeBox.\nUse addition to allow gates on disjoint loci to execute simultaneously, for example doing a PRX on all qubits. The pipe operation ( | ) groups two TimeBoxes together without concatenating.\nThis results in composite TimeBox with two children, the operands, which are scheduled separately.\nUse the pipe to ensure that certain operations execute before some others. Iterables of TimeBoxes are treated as the sum of the elements. This would execute 2 PRX gates on QB1 and QB2 simultaneously: If the last operator was | instead, the second gate on QB2 would execute only after the first 3 gates. Together, these rules provide a handy way of defining complex circuits easily: A TimeBox are made atomic by resolving it using ScheduleBuilder.resolve_timebox() .\nWhen using a framework like IQM Pulla or Exa, the framework will take care of the resolving as part of compilation,\nso the user does not need to do it explicitly. TimeBoxes are resolved recursively: The children of a TimeBox are resolved, and resulting (sub-)Schedules are aligned\naccording to the SchedulingStrategy (ASAP or ALAP) of the TimeBox.\nThe time duration of a TimeBox is determined by its contents and the way they are scheduled during the resolution.\nFinally, all channels are padded with Waits so that the total duration of Instructions on every channel is equal.\nIn other words, the Schedule becomes a \u201crectangle\u201d. An important part of the scheduling are the blocking rules, that is, whether the contents of two TimeBoxes block or\nslide past each other.\nThe rules are: An atomic TimeBox is considered to act on a component if it has instructions on any of the non-virtual channels\nrelated to that component. A composite TimeBox acts on the union of its children\u2019s locus components. A TimeBox blocks all channels related to any component it acts on. When scheduling two TimeBoxes, the instructions will not overlap in time if the TimeBoxes block overlapping channels. In addition to blocking the channels actually present in a TimeBox, it is possible to block neighbouring channels\nas well (for example in order to limit cross-talk).\nThe applied neighbourhood is specified in ScheduleBuilder.resolve_timebox() .\nThe neighbourhood is defined as an integer such that 0 means \u201cblock only the involved channels\u201d,\n1 means \u201cblock the involved channels and the channels of any neighbouring couplers\u201d,\n2 means \u201cthe same as in (1) but in addition block all channels connected by those couplers\u201d, and so on.\nThe blocking rules do not add actual Wait or Block instructions are added to the neighbourhood channels, and two\noverlapping neighbourhoods do not block each other.\nThe blocking comes in question only when actual content would be added to those neighbourhood channels. In practice, the rules and default GateImplementations ensure that the user can concatenate arbitrary gates\nwithout worrying that the gates have an adverse effect on each other.\nFor example, the pulse of a PRX gate playing at the same time as a CZ gate or a measurement would ruin both operations.\nIf overlapping of such gates is desired, the best way is to arrange the Instructions on the Schedule level and wrap the\nschedule into an atomic TimeBox. Note Virtual channels are special channels that exist only to aid the scheduling algorithm.\nExamples are tracking the phases of the MOVE gate, and timing of fast feedback.\nThese channels are removed when the Playlist is finalized. You are encouraged to discover the many features of ScheduleBuilder and TimeBox by reading the\nAPI: ScheduleBuilder , TimeBox .

    "content": "Bases: FluxPulseGate Qubit-resonator MOVE gate using flux pulses on both components. This class implements the extra phase bookkeeping logic required to make the MOVE\ngates work as intended. Due to the unknown phase in the MOVE gate definition, the MOVEs\nneed to be applied in pairs, i.e. the resonator state is always moved back to the qubit\nit came from. Between this pair of MOVE gates you can apply any number of other two-component\ngates (CZs for example) between the resonator and other qubits. This sequence of\ngates acting on the resonator is called a MOVE sandwich . At the end of a sandwich we have\nto apply a local phase correction (z rotation) on the state that was moved back to the qubit. The __call__() method of this class uses the MoveMarker annotation instruction\nto mark the beginning and end of each MOVE sandwich, in order to enable the calculation of the\nangle of the z rotation to be applied on the moved qubit at the end of the sandwich to\ncounteract the phase accumulation during the sandwich relative to the computational frame of\nthe qubit.\nThe phase accumulation has two sources: Phase due to the frequency detuning between the qubit and the resonator,\nproportional to the time duration the MOVE sandwich. Phase due to the virtual z rotations applied on the resonator as\ngates are applied between it and another qubit, which need to be summed up.\nBy convention the resonator VirtualRZ angle of the MOVE implementation itself is currently\nalways zero (since only the sum of the resonator and qubit z rotation angles matters for MOVE),\nbut we also include it in the sum for completeness.

In this way, any such \u201cmember gates\u201d will use\nthe common calibration that exists in builder .

    "content": "Bases: list List of CircuitOperation objects representing a quantum circuit. The class is used to work with CircuitOperations directly. It is mostly meant as\nconvenience to enable easy creation of circuits, calculations of their properties, and mapping them onto physical\nqubits. In addition to the circuit contents, this class has two important attributes: qubits and table . qubits defines the list of qubits which are allowed to be in the loci of all the\nCircuitOperations present in the list. Think about it as Qiskit\u2019s QuantumRegister. table is a QuantumOpTable , which contains all the QuantumOp s which are allowed in the circuit. In most cases, the table is\nsimply taken to contain all the default operations defined in iqm.pulse .\nWhen you use this class with a ScheduleBuilder , it is good practice to set table = builder.op_table . The QuantumOpTable is mutable, so any additional registered\ngates can automatically be usable in any CircuitOperationList associated with that\nScheduleBuilder instance. The fundamental use of the class would be to first define a new instance: The num_qubits parameter populates the qubits attribute with qubits QB1-QBn,\nin this case ['QB1', 'QB2'] . Alternatively, you can provide qubits directly: To add your own QuantumOpTable, initialize like this: Remembering that the table is mutable. If you already have a list of CircuitOperations, you can initialize with it: Calling the find_qubits() method populates the qubits attribute with the qubits found in loci of\nthe operations in the original circuit. If the list is empty, it will set qubits to an empty list,\nwhich most of the time is not what you want to do. The class has the __add__ , __mul__ and __getitem__ methods redefined, which means circuit * 3 , circuit1 + circuit2 and circuit[0:4] will produce a CircuitOperationList\nwith the same qubits and table attributes as the original. To add a prx operation to the list, call: The class also has shortcut methods defined, so the above can be shortened to which is exactly the same syntax as in Qiskit, with the addition of the implementation name\nwhich usually does not need to be used. The names of the shortcut methods are taken from the\nattached table at init. All the operations with non-zero arity\nwill be added as shortcuts. If all the operations in the circuit are unitary, you can calculate the unitary propagator of\nthe entire circuit by calling: The dimension of the unitary will always be defined by the qubits attribute. In particular, if your circuit\ncontains 3 qubits, 'QB1', 'QB2', 'QB3' , but you only add gates to the first two, the resulting unitary will\nstill be an 8x8 matrix, corresponding to the three qubits 'QB1', 'QB2', 'QB3' , in the big endian convention.\nWith no operations affecting 'QB3' , the action of the unitary on this qubit is identity. To map the circuit onto physical qubits, all you need to do is call: This will create a copy of the circuit, with all the placeholder qubits replaced by the physical qubits, with the\norder defined by the qubits attribute. For example, if qubits = ['QB1', 'Alice', 'ZZZ'] , and physical_qubits = ['QB2', 'QB5', 'QB10'] , all occurrences of 'QB1' will be mapped to 'QB2' , 'Alice' to 'QB5' and 'ZZZ' to 'QB10' . The original circuit is not modified, so you can create many copies with\ndifferent physical qubits, which is helpful when running parallel experiments on a large chip. contents ( Iterable [ CircuitOperation ] ) \u2013 Circuit operations to initialize the circuit with.

Set attribute qubits to qubits in the loci of operations in the list.

Array describing the action of the circuit in big endian convention. ndarray Adds a new CircuitOperation to the circuit. Appends a new CircuitOperation at the end of the list. The CircuitOperation is created using a QuantumOp name from the\nQuantumOpTable attached to the CircuitOperationList. The locus of that CircuitOperation is built from the qubits stored in qubits , by selecting\nthe qubits at indices given by locus_indices . For example, if qubits is ['QB1', 'QB2', 'QB4'] , and the locus_indices is [2, 1] , the locus of the new CircuitOperation will be ('QB4', 'QB2') . All arguments for the values of the\nparams of the requested QuantumOp need to be provided. name ( str ) \u2013 Name of the QuantumOp which will generate a new CircuitOperation . locus_indices ( Sequence [ int ] ) \u2013 Indices of the qubits in the attribute .qubits which will become the locus of the operation. args \u2013 Any arguments the CircuitOperation needs, must correspond to the params of the QuantumOp . impl_name ( str | None ) \u2013 Name of the implementation to use when converting the CircuitOperation into\na Timebox later.

The wire k of the second circuit is connected to wire locus_indices[k] of the first. This\nis achieved by mapping the locus of each operation in the second circuit onto the qubits of the first. For example, if the qubits of the first list are ['QB1', 'QB2'] , the second list has ['QB3', 'QB4'] , and the locus_indices argument is [1,0] , all the operations in the second list will have\ntheir 'QB3' mapped to 'QB2' and 'QB4' mapped to 'QB1' . other \u2013 Second CircuitOperationList.

You may define a measurement implementation that uses the Waveform instances Something and SomethingElse as the probe pulse waveforms in the\nI and Q channels as follows: class MyGate(Measure_CustomWaveforms, i_wave=Something, q_wave=SomethingElse) . The measure operation is factorizable, and its arity is 0, which together mean that it can operate\non loci of any dimensionality, but is calibrated only on single component loci. When the gate is constructed in the len(locus) > 1 , case (e.g. builder.get_implementation('measure', ('QB1', 'QB2', 'QB3'))() ) the resulting TimeBox is constructed from the calibrated single-component gates. For each measured component, the readout IQPulse will be modulated with the\nintermediate frequency (IF), computed as the difference between the readout\nfrequency of that component and the probe line center frequency, and offset in phase\nby the readout phase of the component. The measurement is implemented using a ReadoutTrigger instruction, with a duration set by the\nrequirements of the acquisition(s). Note that this is typically different from gates.measure.constant.{locus}.duration , which is the probe pulse duration.

This scheduling algorithm treats the Schedules as hard, rectangular boxes where any ragged edges\nwill be padded with Waits, and the boxes are not allowed to overlap. The algorithm is as follows: 1. When adding child_schedule to schedule , the longest channel in schedule that overlaps with the\nchannels present in child determines the earliest possible starting time for the child_schedule , and all other\nchannels in schedule are padded with Wait to the aforementioned max length. 2. An occupied channel in schedule will always occupy all channels of the corresponding component (qubit,\ncoupler, \u2026). This is handled by keeping track of occupied durations for each component (no unnecessary padding\nis added to channels which do not have an actual physical pulse). 3.

Implements the RZ gate on a specific qubit using a VirtualRZ instruction, which\nsimply changes the phase of the local oscillator driving that qubit.\nThis requires no calibration data as of now.\nThe generated VirtualRZ instruction has the shortest possible duration allowed by the instruments. The virtual z rotation method is based on algebraically commuting the RZ gates towards the end\nof the circuit, until they hit a measurement operation, at which point they are eliminated. It assumes that all the multi-qubit gates in the circuit commute with arbitrary RZ gates (this holds e.g. for CZ\nsince it is diagonal), measurements are projective and happen in the z basis, so that RZ gates that immediately\nprecede them do not affect the measurement result or the state after the measurement, and thus\ncan be removed, and conjugating the single-qubit gates in the circuit with RZ is equivalent to incrementing the phase of the drive\n(holds for PRX ), which can be accomplished either by incrementing the phase of\nthe local oscillator of the drive channel, or incrementing the phases of all the IQPulse s\nfollowing it on the drive channel.

    "content": "Bases: object Describes a native quantum operation type. Quantum operations (or \u201cops\u201d in short), are simple, abstract, self-contained actions one can\nexecute on a station as parts of a quantum circuit. They include quantum gates, measurements,\nand resets. They must have an unambiguous definition in terms of their intended effect on the\ncomputational subspace of the quantum subsystems (qubits, qudits, qumodes\u2026) they act on.\nThey are implemented on the hardware using instruction schedules . A QuantumOp can also be a metaoperation , which (in an idealized picture) has no effect on the\nquantum state, but affects the scheduling of the other ops. Execution barriers are an example of a metaoperation. The ops can have any number of named parameters. For example, PRX is a two-parameter\nquantum gate family, whereas CZ is a single gate with no parameters. A locus (plural: loci) is a tuple[str, ...] (an ordered sequence) of CHAD component names\nan instance of a quantum operation acts on. The locus consists of those QPU components that store the\nquantum information the operation acts on. For example, a CZ gate implemented using a flux\npulse on the coupler connecting the qubits does not include the coupler in its locus, since the\ncoupler is simply an implementation detail. In a quantum circuit each operation type normally has several different loci. For example, you\ncould have a PRX gate being used on qubits {('QB1',), ('QB2',), ('QB5',)} , or a CZ gate used on qubit pairs {('QB1', 'QB3'), ('QB3', 'QB5',), ('QB1', 'QB5',)} . Each quantum operation can have any number of named implementations , each represented by a GateImplementation subclass. For example, we may have two implementations of the CZ gate,\none with just a single flux pulse applied to the coupler, and another one with additional flux\npulses applied to the qubits as well. operation defines the abstract intention (what) implementation defines the concrete method (how) locus defines the target of the operation (where) The quantum operations are typically calibrated using specific calibration experiments that\noutput the required calibration data.

In the idealized computational model we assume that in a (correctly calibrated) quantum computer\nthere is no effective interaction between QPU components (in the computational frame and subspace) while\na Wait instruction is acting on the flux channel of the coupler connecting those components\n(i.e., the coupler is idling).\nHence a QPU component experiences no effective evolution if Wait instructions are\nacting on its drive, flux and probe channels, and the flux channels of all its couplers. Of course, in reality the QPU will experience at least some decoherence during a Wait, and\npossibly some crosstalk.\nIn some applications, e.g. decoherence experiments, it is essential to Wait for a specific time,\nsince it\u2019s precisely the decoherence that we are interested in. However, if we are only interested in applying well-defined local quantum operations on specific\nloci, it is essential to shut down all unwanted dynamics by adding Block instructions on\ncontrol channels of the unused and neighboring channels.\nThey act like Waits (and are converted into Waits at the end of the scheduling), but are allowed\nto overlap in time, since we are only interested in blocking those channels for the duration of the\nquantum operation. schedule ( Schedule ) \u2013 instruction schedule to modify locus ( set [ str ] ) \u2013 information-carrying QPU components schedule is meant to operate on (does not include couplers) neighborhood ( int ) \u2013 How far should we block neighboring QPU components?\nZero means just the locus qubits, one means neighboring couplers, two means their neighboring\nqubits etc. schedule , with added Block instructions on all the neighbor channels,\nfor the duration of the schedule None Build a playlist from a number of instruction schedules.

    "content": "A tree-structured container for Settings . The SettingNode class combines a bunch of Settings together.\nIt may also contain other SettingNodes.\nTogether, the contents form a tree structure that provides a useful way of grouping Settings. As an example, we manually construct a tree of SettingNodes with some dummy Settings, but it is usually not necessary.\nThe root node in the following examples is called 'node' . The easiest way to see the content of the node is the SettingNode.print_tree() method: We see that the 'root' node has two children, named 'root.flux' and 'root.pulse' , which\nthemselves are also SettingNodes.\nThis follows the typical naming convention in EXA: Subnodes include the names of their parents, separated by a dot. The children contain some dummy Settings, showing the keys, labels and current values. For other ways to access the content of the node, see also SettingNode.children , SettingNode.all_settings , and SettingNode.nodes_by_type() . The values within the nodes can be accessed using the attribute or dictionary syntax: The values can be changed with a simple = syntax: Note node.setting refers to the Setting object. node.setting.value syntax refers to the data stored inside. Adding and deleting new Settings and nodes is simple: It is usually a good idea to make a copy of the original node, so that it won\u2019t be modified accidentally. To merge values of two SettingNodes, there are helpers SettingNode.merge() and SettingNode.merge_values() . The first one merges the tree structure and values of two nodes and outputs a third one as a result. None values are always replaced by a proper value if such exists. In case of conflicting nodes or values,\nthe content of the first argument takes priority. Note how the result has values from node.flux , but also settings node.pulse that do not exist in node.flux . The SettingNode.merge_values() method is an in-place operation that only changes\nthe values of Settings that already exist in the node, if possible: Sometimes, it is easier to collect values in a dictionary and set them all at once by using SettingNode.set_from_dict() . The nested structure of the dictionary should match\nthe structure of the SettingNode. Keys that are not found in the tree are silently ignored, unless the strict flag is used.

Current implementation uses HTTP calls to the remote station control service,\nthat is controlling the station control instance. root_url ( str ) \u2013 Remote station control service URL. get_token_callback ( Callable [ [ ] , str ] | None ) \u2013 A callback function that returns a token (str) which will be passed in Authorization header\nin all requests. Station control client implements generic query methods for certain objects,\nlike query_observations() , query_observation_sets() , and query_sequence_metadatas() .\nThese methods accept only keyword arguments as parameters, which are based on the syntax field__lookup=value .\nNote double-underscore in the name, to separate field names like dut_field from lookup types like in .\nThe syntax is based on Django implementation, documented here and here . As a convenience, when no lookup type is provided (like in dut_label=\"foo\" ),\nthe lookup type is assumed to be exact ( dut_label__exact=\"foo\" ). Other supported lookup types are: For example, created_timestamp__range=(datetime(2023, 10, 12), datetime(2024, 10, 14)) For example, dut_field__in=[\"QB1.frequency\", \"QB2.readout.frequency\"] For example, origin_uri__icontains=\"local\" For example, tags__overlap=[\"calibration=good\", \"2023-12-04\"] For example, tags__contains=[\"calibration=good\", \"2023-12-04\"] For example, end_timestamp__isnull=False In addition to model fields (like \u201cdut_label\u201d, \u201cdut_field\u201d, \u201ccreated_timestamp\u201d, \u201cinvalid\u201d, etc.),\nall of our generic query methods accept also following shared query parameters: For example, latest=\"invalid\" would return only one result (latest \u201ccreated_timestamp\u201d)\nfor each different \u201cinvalid\u201d value in the database. Thus, maximum three results would be returned,\none for each invalid value of True , False , and None . order_by: str. Prefix with \u201c-\u201d for descending order, for example \u201c-created_timestamp\u201d. limit: int: Default 20. If 0 (or negative number) is given, then pagination is not used, i.e. limit=infinity. offset: int. Default 0. Our generic query methods are not fully generalized yet, thus not all fields and lookup types are supported.\nCheck query methods own documentation for details about currently supported query parameters. Generic query methods will return a list of objects, but with additional (optional) \u201cmeta\u201d attribute,\nwhich contains metadata, like pagination details. The client can ignore this data,\nor use it to implement pagination logic for example to fetch all results available.

    "content": "IQM Benchmarks is a suite of Quantum Characterization, Verification, and Validation (QCVV) tools for quantum computing. It is designed to be a comprehensive tool for benchmarking quantum hardware. The suite is designed to be modular, allowing users to easily add new benchmarks and customize existing ones. The suite is designed to be easy to use, with a simple API that allows users to run benchmarks with a single command. Below is a list of the benchmarks currently available in the suite: Gates / Layers: Standard Clifford Randomized Benchmarking [ Phys. Rev. A 85, 042311 (2012)] Interleaved Randomized Benchmarking [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 080505 (2012)] Compressive Gate Set Tomography [ PRX Quantum 4, 010325 (2023)] Mirror Randomized Benchmarking [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 150502 (2022)] Holistic: Quantum Volume [ Phys. Rev. A 100, 032328 (2019)] CLOPS [ arXiv:2110.14108 [quant-ph] (2021)] Entanglement: GHZ State Fidelity [ arXiv:0712.0921 [quant-ph] (2007)] Optimization: Q-Score [ IEEE Trans. Quantum Eng., 2 (2021)] The project is split into different benchmarks, all sharing the Benchmark class or the legacy BenchmarkBase class. Each individual benchmark takes as an argument their own BenchmarkConfigurationBase class. All the (legacy) benchmarks executed at once are wrapped by the BenchmarkExperiment class, which handles dependencies among the benchmarks, storing the results, producing the plots\u2026 uv is highly recommended for practical Python environment and package management.\nWith uv installed in your system, start a terminal in your machine and create a new Python environment Note: refer to uv\u2019s documentation if there are problems setting up a Python environment. After the command has run, read the output and make sure to use the prompt to activate the environment.\nThen, you can install the latest release of the IQM Benchmarks by running: Supplied within the Python package there is an additional requirements.txt file containing locked, security scanned\ndependencies. The file can be used to constrain installed dependencies either directly from the repo or by\nextracting it from the PyPI package. Optional dependencies like compressive gate set tomography and jupyter notebooks can be installed as follows: Current optional dependencies are: examples : Jupyter notebooks mgst : Compressive gate set tomography test : Code testing and Linting docs : Documentation building cicd : CICD tools To install in development mode with all required dependencies, you can instead clone the repository and from the project directory run To run the tests, you can use the following command: To build the API documentation as HTML: Update the requirements. This is necessary when you add a new dependency or update an existing one in pyproject.toml .\nAfter this, any changes in the lockfile requirements.txt have to be committed.\nThe script upgrades locked dependencies defined in pyproject.toml within the given version ranges. However, transitive\ndependencies are deliberately not upgraded automatically. The IQM Benchmarks suite is designed to be used with real quantum hardware. To use the suite, you will need to have access to a quantum computer. The suite is designed to work with both IQM Resonance (IQM\u2019s quantum cloud service) and on-prem devices, but can be easily adapted to work with other quantum computing platforms. To use the suite with IQM Resonance, you will need to set up an account and obtain an API token. You can then set the IQM_TOKEN environment variable to your API token. The suite will automatically use this token to authenticate with IQM Resonance. You can easily set up one or more benchmarks by defining a configuration for them. For example, for Randomized, Interleaved and Mirror Benchmarking, or Quantum Volume: In order to execute them, you must specify a backend. for IQM Resonance this can be given as a simple string, such as \u201cgarnet\u201d (together with your IQM Token environment variable) and for an on-prem device and IQM Resonance this can be defined using the URL of the quantum computer. Also, you need to reference the benchmark configuration you want to run: Full examples on how to run benchmarks and analyze the results can be found in the examples folder. This repository can be setup to perform a scheduled (weekly, daily\u2026) benchmark from a Gitlab/Github pipeline, executed on a real device. An example configuration is given in the scheduled_experiments folder. previous IQM Benchmarks next Examples By IQM Benchmarks developers \u00a9 Copyright 2024, IQM. Last updated on 2025-02-21."

We can access the Star backend and plot its connectivity graph to check that everything is working properly. We run the cell below to ignore those warnings that are not critical for the correct run of the benchmarks. The GHZ (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) state is a maximally entangled quantum state that involves three or more qubits, \\(n\\) . It is an equal superposition of all qubits being in state 0 and all qubits being in state 1, i.e., \\(| GHZ \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}+|1\\rangle^{\\otimes n})\\) . The GHZ state fidelity acts as a witness for genuine multi-qubit entanglement if found to be above \\(0.5\\) . This means that the measurement results cannot be explained without entanglement involving all qubits, so it is a great way to evaluate the \u201cquantumness\u201d of the computer. The state \\(\\rho_{\\text{ideal}}= |GHZ\\rangle\\langle GHZ|\\) is a pure state, so in this case the fidelity can be computed as: where \\(\\rho_{\\text{measured}}\\) is the density matrix given by the actual results of the quantum computer. The ideal GHZ state density matrix entries can be written as \\(\\rho_{i,j}=\\langle i| \\rho_{\\text{ideal}} | j \\rangle\\) where \\(i,j\\) are the \\(n\\) basis states \\(\\{|00..0\\rangle, ..., |11..1\\rangle\\}\\) ; only the corner entries \\(\\rho_{0,0},\\rho_{0,n},\\rho_{n,0}\\) and \\(\\rho_{n,n} \\) are non-zero. This simplifies the process since we only need to measure these four components. In the fidelity formula, all other entries are effectively nullified by the zero entries in the ideal state matrix. To measure the coherences (off-diagonal entries) we use the method of multiple quantum coherences Mooney, 2021 . Quantum volume is a single-number metric that was introduced in Cross, 2019 . It evaluates the quality of a quantum processor via the largest random square circuit, i.e., with the same number of layers of parallel random 2-qubit unitaries as number of qubits, that it can run successfully. The success of a run is based on the heavy output probability, which corresponds to the probability of observing heavy outputs , i.e. the measurement outputs that occcur with a probability greater than the median of the distribution. The heavy output generation problem asks if the generated distribution of the random circuit we run contains heavy outputs at least 2/3 of the time (on average) with a high confidence level, typically higher than 97.5%. It can be shown that the heavy output probability for an ideal device is at around 0.85 asymptotically.\nThe quantum volume is then defined as where \\(n \\leq N\\) is a number of qubits and \\(d(n)\\) is the achievable depth , i.e. the largest depth such that we are confident the probability of observing a heavy output is greater than 2/3. We define a combination of qubits to test quantum volume on. Due to the star topology, the combinations must not contain the index of the resontor \u201c0\u201d.

Warning: The following code cell may take few minutes to run since it will compute the benchmark on all the qubit layouts specified above. CLOPS is a metric that estimates the speed at which a quantum computer can execute Quantum Volume (QV) layers of a quantum circuit. That is, the circuits to calculate this benchmark have the same structure as the ones used for QV. Here we follow the definition introduced in ( Wack, 2021 ), but other versions of this benchmark exist. CLOPS is measured by means of a quantum variational-like protocol, where templates of parametrized QV circuits are assigned random parameters, executed, and outcomes are used as a seed to assign new parameters and repeat the process. The ratio of number of templates ( \\(M\\) ), parameter updates ( \\(K\\) ), measurement shots ( \\(S\\) ) and QV layers ( \\(\\log_2\\mathrm{QV}\\) ) with the time taken to run all, constitutes the CLOPS value: Notice that the total CLOPS time includes that of assignment of parameters, submission of circuits and retrieval of results.

We define a combination of qubits to test quantum volume on. Due to the star topology, the combinations must contain at least qubit #2 (see topmost graph). If you want to modify the settings above, please refer to the documentation here . Warning: The following code cell may take few minutes to run since it will compute the benchmark on all the qubit layouts specified above. CLOPS is a metric that estimates the speed at which a quantum computer can execute Quantum Volume (QV) layers of a quantum circuit. That is, the circuits to calculate this benchmark have the same structure as the ones used for QV.

If you want to modify the settings above, please refer to the documentation here . The idea behind Clifford Randomized Benchmarking (CRB) is that under certain (simplified) types of noise, the average survival probability of an initial state \\(|0\\rangle\\) under random sequences of Clifford gates and a final sequence inverse will decay exponentially in the length of the sequences. This can be written as where \\(C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_m\\) is the random sequences of Clifford gates, \\(C_\\text{inv}=(C_1C_2\\cdots{C}_m)^{-1}\\) , \\(0\\leq{p}\\leq{1}\\) and \\(0\\leq{A,B}\\leq1\\) are constants isolating the effects of state-preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors ( Magesan,2012 ). From such decay, one can in turn infer the average fidelity of the corresponding Clifford group. The main assumption we will make here is that the noise can be modeled as Markovian, time-stationary and gate-independent. The theory of CRB under these approximations, and the fact that the multi-qubit Clifford group is a unitary 2-design (i.e., uniformly averaging with two pairs of \\(C\\) , \\(C^{\\dagger}\\) Clifford operators gives the same result as using fully random unitaries), ensures that the average fidelity of our gate set is given by CRB is not generally intended to work for \\(n>2\\) , both because of the scaling of the size of the \\(n\\) -qubit Clifford group in \\(n\\) , and because such gates have to eventually be transpiled to a native basis of 1Q and 2Q gates! It is important to mention that the average Clifford fidelity is related to the average fidelity of IQM\u2019s native gate set for single-qubit gates as ( Barends, 2014 ) This is because all the single-qubit Clifford gates can be decomposed using on average 1.875 gates from IQM\u2019s native set. This formula shows that the value of \\(\\overline{F}_\\text{GATE}\\) will always be slightly higher than \\(\\overline{F}_\\text{CRB}\\) , so one must be careful when comparing with average fidelities reported in the specs of a QPU. If you want to modify the settings above, please refer to the documentation here . Warning: The following code cell may take few minutes to run since it will compute the average fidelities for all the qubits in the QPU (and we set parallel_execution=False ). Differently from the previous protocol, this benchmark aims at estimating the average fidelity of an individual quantum gate. This can be achieved interleaving random Clifford gates between the gate of interest. This method was introduced in Magesan, 2012 , and just as CRB, it is robust with respect to SPAM errors. The protocol runs two sets of sequences, one solely made up of random Clifford gates, as in CRB, and one made up of random Clifford sequences but interleaving the gate of interest among these (and compiling the corresponding sequence inverse). IRB then extracts the corresponding decay parameters (where we expect the decay rate for IRB to be smaller than the CRB one, because the sequence is longer), and the average fidelity of the gate we wish to characterize is then calculated with a simple formula using the two decay parameters. If you want to modify the settings above, please refer to the documentation here . NB: Clifford RB is executed by default when running Interleaved RB!

The Q-score measures the maximum number of qubits that can be used\neffectively to solve the MaxCut combinatorial optimization problem with the Quantum Approximate\nOptimization Algorithm - Martiel,2021 The graphs chosen for the benchmark are random Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graphs with 50% edge-probability between nodes.\nThe obtained cost of the solution, i.e. the average number of cut edges, must be above a certain threshold.

Typical performance for IQM Spark is summarized in the table below and compared to the values obtained with your device.

    "content": "The aim of this benchmark is to show whether a GHZ state with high enough fidelity can be prepared such that the state is genuinely multipartite entangled. One can show that a fidelity larger than 0.5 is a sufficient condition (see Leibfried, D. et al., Creation of a six-atom \u2018Schr\u00f6dinger cat\u2019 state. Nature 438, 639\u2013642 (2005)) The benchmark currently offers two methods to estimate the fidelity: Multiple quantum coherences (G. J. Mooney et al., Generation and verification of 27-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states in a superconducting quantum computer, J. Phys. Commun. 5, 095004 (2021)) Randomized measurements (Elben, A. et al., Statistical correlations between locally randomized measurements: A toolbox for probing entanglement in many-body quantum states, Phys. Rev. A 99, 052323 (2019)) Additionally, for a given set of \\(n\\) qubits, different circuits can be applied which lead to the same GHZ state. Currently there are the following implementations: \u201cnaive\u201d: The textbook ciruit of depth \\(n\\) , which starts from a Hadamrd gate on one qubit and entangles each additional qubit with a CNOT operation from the first. \u201clog_depth\u201d: A logarithmic depth circuit utilizing parallel CNOT applications. Either the method in Cruz et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05572 or the method in Mooney et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08946 is used, depending on which yields the lower depth or the lower number of 2-qubit gates. \u201ctree\u201d: An in-house logarithmic depth circuit utilizing calibration data of the CZ-fidelities and a tree-graph algorithm to find a circuit with minimal depth and high fidelity 2-qubit gates. Note that the first two methods will always give the same circuit for the same qubit layout (and the same coupling map), while the \u201ctree\u201d method relies on the latest calibration fidelities and can give different circuits on different days.\nThus for consistent comparisons one of the first two methods should be chosen, while for the best results, i.e. the largest possible GME entangled GHZ state, the tree-method is preferable. The important parameters are: custom_qubits_array : A list[list[int]] which includes all qubit layouts on which the benchmark is run. shots : The number of shots for the fidelity measurement fidelity_routine : Either \u201ccoherences\u201d or \u201crandomized_measurements\u201d rem : Boolean value that controls whether readout error mitigation is used mit_shots : Whenever rem=True, this parameter controls the total number of shots used to calibrate readout error mitgation num_RMs : The number of randomized measurement settings (only necessary when choosing fidelity_routine=randomized_measurements ) For thinking about which qubit layouts to use, the following visualization of the connectivity is helpful. It requires the package rustworkx and access to the backend, in this example IQMFakeApollo . Whenever the connectivity graph turns out scrambled, 1-2 reruns of the cell usually lead to a a readable graph drawing. To see individual fidelitiy and uncertainty values of a given qubit layout, one can filter the result.observations -list by layout as shown below. The plot allows a comparison of all layout results with and without REM, where the data point description labels \u201cL0\u201d, \u201cL1\u201d, \u2026 enumerate the layouts in the order defined in the configuration. previous Circuit Layer Operations Per Second (CLOPS) next Greenberger\u2013Horne\u2013Zeilinger (GHZ) State Fidelity By IQM Benchmarks developers \u00a9 Copyright 2024, IQM.

    "content": "This notebook gives an introduction on how to run compressive gate set tomography, what the input parameters mean and how to display different observations and plots. This notebook and the compressive GST functionality requires the optional dependency \u201cmgst\u201d to be installed. For background, see the journal reference at https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.010325 The most important parameters are the following: qubits ( List[int] ): The qubits on the backend where the experiment is performed. gate_set ( Union[str, List[Type[QuantumCircuit]]] ): Either one of the currently predefined gate sets \"1QXYI\" , \"2QXYCZ\" , \"2QXYCZ_extended\" , \"3QXYCZ\" , or a list of quantum circuits. num_circuits ( int ): The number of circuits for the experiment. Recommended are at least 50 for single qubit GST, at least 300 for two-qubit GST and at least 2000 for 3-qubit GST. shots ( int ): The number of shots per circuit. rank ( int ): The Kraus rank of the reconstruction, i.e. the number of Kraus operators for each gate.\n$ \\( G(\\rho) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{\\text{rank}} K_i \\rho K_i^{\\dagger}\\) $\nSetting rank=1 will trigger a unitary gate fit, leading to a gate parametrization output in terms Hamiltonian parameters.\nThe maximum rank is given by the physical dimension squared. For fully rigorous performance computation of metrics such as the average gate fidelity or the diamond distance it is recommended to choose full rank.\nA low rank has the benefit of needing less circuits and less computing time, while still capturing the dominant error sources. bootstrap_samples ( int ): If bootstrapping error bars are to be generated, this variable sets the number of bootstrap runs. Recommended for trustworthy error bars are 50 samples. The default is 0, since computing bootstrap error bars is very time consuming. Be prepared that the first execution on a new system will take an extra 1-2 minutes to compile the lower level optimization code. For uncertaintites on the observations set bootstrap_samples \\(\\geq 10\\) . The high level results are stored in a list of Observations under restult.observations .\nTo access only those observations corresponding to a specific qubit layout, one can use the identifier attribute: In addition to the high level observations above, the full process matrices for each gate and the full parametrizations for initial state and measurement are stored. They can be accessed under result.dataset.attrs[f\"results_layout_{qubit_layout}\"] as follows. Two gate sets are saved, the raw gate set and the gauge-optimized gate set.\nIn most instances the gauge-optimized gate set should be used for further processing, since it gives the gate set in the reference frame in which the target gates are defined. The \"raw_gates\" and \"gauge_opt_gates\" keys in the outcome dictionary contain a 3D numpy array, where i.e. gate #1 is accessed with raw_results[\"gauge_opt_state\"][0] , and so on. The plots can be accessed in the notebook via result.plots, a dictionary containing all figure objects. These can then be diplayed as shown below, or saved to disc from the notebook.\nCurrently all gauge optimized gate superoperators are shown as matrix plots in their Pauli basis representation, while the state preparation and measurement outcomes are shown as matrix plots in standard basis.\nFor reference, a sinlge qubit superoperator for gate \\(G\\) in the Pauli-basis has entries \\(G_{ij}\\) defined via\n$ \\(\nG(\\rho) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j = 1}^4 G_{ij} P_i Tr(P_j \\rho),\n\\) \\(\nwhere \\) P_i, P_j$ are Pauli matrices. In addition to gate plots, selections of gate error measures and gate parameters are also stored in figure objects. Stored plot names can be displayed and individually plotted as follows. Alternatively, all plots (of all layouts) can be displayed via result.plot_all() . In this example we define a gate set ourselves as a list of quantum circuits. The example gate set chosen here is the \u201cXYI\u201d gate set with the addition of \\(\\pi\\) -rotations around the X- and Y-axis.\nNote that we also increased the number of random GST sequences in the GST configuration from 50 to 100 to account for the larger gate set. previous Mirror Randomized Benchmarking (MRB) next Quantum Volume (QV) By IQM Benchmarks developers \u00a9 Copyright 2024, IQM.

Note IQM provides access to its quantum computers via IQM Resonance \u2013 IQM\u2019s quantum cloud service.\nPlease head over to our website to learn more. Here\u2019s a quick and easy way to run a small computation on an IQM quantum computer to check that\nthings are set up correctly, either\nthrough the IQM cloud service Resonance, or using an on-premises quantum computer. Login to IQM Resonance with your credentials. Upon your first visit to IQM Resonance, you can generate your unique, non-recoverable API token\ndirectly from the Dashboard page by selecting Generate token . It\u2019s important to copy the token\nimmediately from the window, as you won\u2019t be able to do so once the window is closed. If you lose\nyour token, you have the option to regenerate it at any time. However, be aware that regenerating\nyour API token will invalidate any previously generated token. Download one of the demo notebooks from IQM Academy or the resonance_example.py example file (Save Page As\u2026) Install Qiskit on IQM as instructed below. Add your API token to the example (either as the parameter token to the IQMProvider constructor, or by setting the environment variable IQM_TOKEN ) Run the Jupyter notebook (or run python resonance_example.py if you decided to go for the Python script). If you\u2019re connecting to a real quantum computer, the output should show almost half of the\nmeasurements resulting in \u201800000\u2019 and almost half in \u201811111\u2019 - if this is the case, things are\nset up correctly! You can find a video guide on how to set things up here .\nMore ready-to-run examples can also be found at IQM Academy . Download the bell_measure.py example file (Save Page As\u2026). Install Qiskit on IQM as instructed below. Install Cortex CLI and log in as instructed in the documentation Set the environment variable as instructed by Cortex CLI after logging in. Run $ python bell_measure.py --cortex_server_url https://demo.qc.iqm.fi/cocos - replace the example URL with the correct one. If you\u2019re connecting to a real quantum computer, the output should show almost half of the\nmeasurements resulting in \u201800\u2019 and almost half in \u201811\u2019 - if this is the case, things are set up\ncorrectly! The recommended way is to install the distribution package qiskit-iqm directly from the\nPython Package Index (PyPI): After installation Qiskit on IQM can be imported in your Python code as follows: If you are using IQM Resonance, you have two options to authenticate: Set the IQM_TOKEN environment variable to the API token obtained from the Resonance dashboard. Pass the token parameter to IQMProvider . This will be forwarded to IQMClient . For an example, see the resonance_example.py file If the IQM server you are connecting to requires authentication, you may use Cortex CLI to retrieve and automatically refresh access tokens,\nthen set the IQM_TOKENS_FILE environment variable, as instructed, to point to the tokens file.\nSee Cortex CLI\u2019s documentation for details. You may also authenticate yourself using the IQM_AUTH_SERVER , IQM_AUTH_USERNAME and IQM_AUTH_PASSWORD environment variables, or pass them as\narguments to IQMProvider , however this approach is less secure and considered deprecated. In this section we demonstrate the practicalities of using Qiskit on IQM to execute\nquantum circuits on an IQM quantum computer. Let\u2019s consider the following quantum circuit which prepares and measures a GHZ state: To run this circuit on an IQM quantum computer you need to initialize an IQMProvider instance with the IQM server URL, use it to retrieve an IQMBackend instance representing\nthe quantum computer, and use Qiskit\u2019s transpile() function\nfollowed by IQMBackend.run() as usual. shots denotes the number of times the quantum\ncircuit(s) are sampled: Note As of qiskit >= 1.0 , Qiskit no longer supports execute() . Instead you should\nfirst transpile the circuit and then run it, as shown in the code above.\nSee the Transpilation section to learn how to transpile circuits in various ways. Note If you want to inspect the circuits that are sent to the device, use the circuit_callback keyword argument of IQMBackend.run() . See also Inspecting circuits before submitting them for execution for inspecting the actual run request sent for\nexecution. Note IQM Client is transitioning from server-side API APIVariant.V1 to a new APIVariant.V2 .\nYou may see a deprecation warning in the terminal. You can ignore it; when V2 becomes the default,\nQiskit-on-IQM will transparently start using it. Alternatively, you can set an environment variable IQM_CLIENT_API_VARIANT to value APIVariant.V2 . The choice of the API version does not affect the use\nof Qiskit-on-IQM. You can optionally provide IQMBackend specific options as additional keyword arguments to IQMBackend.run() , documented at IQMBackend.create_run_request() .\nFor example, you can enable heralding measurements using circuit_compilation_options as follows: The calibration data for an IQM quantum computer is stored in a calibration set . An IQMBackend instance\nalways corresponds to a specific calibration set, so that its transpilation target uses only those QPU components\n(qubits and computational resonators) and gates which are available in that calibration set. The server default\ncalibration set will be used by default, but you can also use a different calibration set by specifying the calibration_set_id parameter to IQMProvider.get_backend() or IQMBackend . If the server default\ncalibration set has changed after you have created the backend, the backend will still use the original default calibration\nset when submitting circuits for execution. When this happens you will get a warning.\nYou will need to create a new backend if you want to use the new default calibration set instead. The results of a job that was executed on the IQM quantum computer, represented as a Result instance, can be inspected using the usual Qiskit methods: The result comes with some metadata, such as the RunRequest that\nproduced it in result.request . The request contains e.g. the qubit mapping and the ID of the\ncalibration set that were used in the execution: Another piece of useful metadata are the timestamps of the various steps of processing the job. The\ntimestamps are stored in the dict result.timestamps . The job processing has three steps, compile where the circuits are converted to instruction schedules, submit where the instruction schedules are submitted for execution, and execution where the instruction schedules are executed and the measurement results are returned. The dict contains a timestamp for the start and end of each step.\nFor example, the timestamp of starting the circuit compilation is stored with key compile_start .\nIn the same way the other steps have their own timestamps with keys consisting of the step name and a _start or _end suffix. In addition to processing step timestamps, there are also timestamps for the job itself, job_start for when the job request was received by the server and job_end for when the job processing\nwas finished. If the processing of the job is terminated before it is complete, for example due to an error, the timestamps of\nprocessing steps that were not taken are not present in the dict. For example: The IQMBackend instance we created above provides all the standard backend functionality that one expects from a\nbackend in Qiskit. For this example, I am connected to an IQMBackend that features a 5-qubit chip with star-like\nconnectivity: Let\u2019s examine its basis gates and the coupling map through the backend instance Note that for IQMBackends the identity gate id is not actually a gate that is executed on the device and is simply omitted.\nAt IQM we identify qubits by their names, e.g. \u2018QB1\u2019, \u2018QB2\u2019, etc. as demonstrated above. In Qiskit, qubits are\nidentified by their indices in the quantum register, as you can see from the printed coupling map above. Most of the\ntime you do not need to deal with IQM-style qubit names when using Qiskit, however when you need, the methods IQMBackendBase.qubit_name_to_index() and IQMBackendBase.index_to_qubit_name() can become handy. Some IQM quantum computers support classically controlled gates, that is, gates that are executed\nconditionally depending on the result of a measurement preceding them in the quantum circuit. This\nsupport currently has several limitations: Only the x , y , rx , ry and r gates can be classically controlled. The gates can only be conditioned on one classical bit, and the only control available is to\napply the gate if the bit is 1, and apply an identity gate if the bit is 0. The availability of the controlled gates depends on the instrumentation of the quantum computer. The classical control can be applied on a circuit instruction using c_if() : The first measurement operation stores its result in the 1-bit classical register c . If the\nresult is 1, the X gate will be applied. If it is zero, an identity gate of corresponding\nduration is applied instead. Executing the above circuit should result in the counts being approximately 50/50 split\nbetween the \u201800 0\u2019 and \u201811 1\u2019 bins of the histogram (even though the state itself is never entangled). Note Because the gates can only take feedback from one classical bit you must place the measurement result\nin a 1-bit classical register, c in the above example. The qiskit.circuit.Reset operation can be used to reset qubits to the \\(|0\\rangle\\) state.\nIt is currently implemented as a (projective) measurement followed by a classically controlled X gate conditioned\non the result, and is only available if the quantum computer supports classically controlled gates. In the above example, the Hadamard gate prepares a uniform superposition of the \\(|0\\rangle\\) and \\(|1\\rangle\\) states, and the reset then collapses it back into the \\(|0\\rangle\\) state.\nExecuting the circuit should result in (mostly) zeros being measured. It is possible to inspect the final circuits that would be submitted for execution before actually submitting them,\nwhich can be useful for debugging purposes. This can be done using IQMBackend.create_run_request() , which returns\na RunRequest containing the circuits and other data. The method accepts the same\nparameters as IQMBackend.run() . It is also possible to print a run request when it is actually submitted by setting the environment variable IQM_CLIENT_DEBUG=1 . In this section we study how the circuit gets transpiled in more detail. You can use the default Qiskit transpiler on IQM quantum computers with both\nthe Crystal and the Star architectures.\nStarting from the GHZ circuit we created above: Under the hood the Qiskit transpiler uses the IQMDefaultSchedulingPlugin plugin that\nautomatically adapts the transpiled circuit to the IQMBackend. In particular, if optimization_level > 0 , the plugin will use the IQMOptimizeSingleQubitGates pass to optimize single-qubit gates, and for devices that have the IQM Star architecture, the plugin will use the IQMNaiveResonatorMoving pass to automatically insert MoveGate instructions\nas needed. Alternatively, you can use the transpile_to_IQM() function for more precise control over the\ntranspilation process as documented below. It is also possible to use one of our other pre-defined transpiler plugins as an argument to transpile() , for example transpile(circuit, backend=backend, scheduling_method=\"only_move_routing_keep\") .\nAdditionally, you can use any of our transpiler passes\nto define your own qiskit.transpiler.PassManager if you want to assemble custom\ntranspilation procedures manually. The IQM Star architecture includes computational resonators as additional QPU components,\nand uses qubit-resonator gates instead of two-qubit gates. These include MoveGate which moves qubit states to and from the resonators. The standard Qiskit transpiler does not know how to compile qubit-resonator gates.\nThis is why IQMBackend provides the Qiskit transpiler a simplified transpilation target in which\nthe resonators and MOVE gates have been abstracted away, and replaced with fictional two-qubit gates\nthat directly connect qubits that can be made to interact via a resonator. It then\nuses IQMDefaultSchedulingPlugin to re-introduce resonators and add MOVE gates between qubits and resonators as necessary at the scheduling stage. IQMDefaultSchedulingPlugin is executed automatically when you use the Qiskit transpiler.\nStarting from the GHZ circuit we created above: As an alternative to the native Qiskit transpiler integration, you can use the transpile_to_IQM() function.  It is meant for users who want at least one of the following: more fine grained control over the transpilation process without having to figure out which IQM\ntranspiler plugin to use, transpile Star architecture circuits that already contain qubit-resonator gates, or force the transpiler to use a strict subset of qubits on the device. For example, if you want to transpile the circuit with optimization_level=0 but also apply the\nsingle qubit gate optimization pass, you can do one of the following, equivalent things: Similarly, if you want to transpile a native Star architecture circuit that already contains MoveGate instances (that act on a qubit and a computational resonator), you can do the following: And if you want force the compiler to use a strict subset of qubits on the device, you can do the following: Note that if you do this, you do need to provide the IQMBackend.run() method a qubit\nmapping that matches the restriction: For the native integration of the custom IQM transpiler passes with the Qiskit transpiler, we\nhave implemented several scheduling plugins for the Qiskit transpiler. These plugins can be used as\nthe scheduling_method string argument for transpile() .\nThe mapping between these strings and the classes that implement the plugins is defined in the pyproject.toml file of this package.\nThe documentation of these plugins in found in the respective plugin classes. If you are unsure which plugin to use, you can use transpile_to_IQM() with the appropriate\narguments. This function determines which plugin to use based on the backend and the provided\narguments.  Note that the Qiskit transpiler automatically uses the IQMDefaultSchedulingPlugin when the backend is an IQMBackend. It is possible to submit multiple circuits to be executed, as a batch. In many cases this is more\ntime efficient than running the circuits one by one. Batch execution has some restrictions: all the\ncircuits must be executed for the same number of shots. For starters,\nlet\u2019s construct two circuits preparing and measuring different Bell states: Now, we can run them together in a batch: The batch execution functionality can be used to run a parameterized circuit for various concrete values of parameters: Note that it is important to transpile the parameterized circuit before binding the values to ensure a consistent qubit\nmeasurements across circuits in the batch. When multiple measurement instructions are present in a circuit, the measurements may be multiplexed, meaning the\nmeasurement pulses would be simultaneously executed on the quantum hardware, if possible. Multiplexing requires the\nmeasurement instructions to form a convex subgraph, i.e. not have other instructions between them acting on the same\nqubits. You don\u2019t have to do anything special to enable multiplexing, it is automatically attempted by the\ncircuit-to-pulse compiler on the server side. However, you can ensure multiplexing (whenever\npossible on the hardware level) by putting a barrier instruction before and after a group of\nmeasurements.  This prevents the transpiler from inserting any other instructions between the\nmeasurements.  There is no concept of multiplexed or simultaneous measurements in Qiskit, so the\ncircuit diagram will not indicate any multiplexing: In this section we show how to simulate the execution of quantum circuits on IQM quantum computers. Note Since the simulation happens locally, you do not need access to an actual quantum computer. The execution of circuits can be simulated locally, with a noise model to mimic the real hardware as\nmuch as possible.  To this end, Qiskit on IQM provides the class IQMFakeBackend that can\nbe instantiated with properties of a certain QPU, e.g. using functions such as IQMFakeAdonis() , IQMFakeApollo() and IQMFakeAphrodite() that represent specific IQM quantum architectures with pre-defined, representative noise models. Above, we use an IQMFakeAdonis() instance to run a noisy simulation of circuit on a simulated 5-qubit Adonis chip.\nThe noise model includes relaxation ( \\(T_1\\) ) and dephasing ( \\(T_2\\) ), gate infidelities and readout errors.\nIf you want to customize the noise model instead of using the default one provided by IQMFakeAdonis() , you can create\na copy of the IQMFakeBackend instance with an updated error profile: Circuits can be executed against a mock environment: an IQM server that has no real quantum computer hardware.\nResults from such executions are random bits. This may be useful when developing and testing software integrations. Qiskit on IQM contains IQMFacadeBackend , which allows to combine the mock remote execution with a local\nnoisy quantum circuit simulation. This way you can both validate your integration as well as get an idea of the expected circuit execution results. To run a circuit this way, use the \"facade_adonis\" backend retrieved from the provider. Note that the provider must be\ninitialized with the URL of a quantum computer with the equivalent architecture (i.e. names of qubits, their\nconnectivity, and the native gateset should match the 5-qubit Adonis architecture). Note When a classical register is added to the circuit, Qiskit fills it with classical bits of value 0 by default. If the\nregister is not used later, and the circuit is submitted to the IQM server, the results will not contain those\n0-filled bits. To make sure the facade backend returns results in the same format as a real IQM server, IQMFacadeBackend.run() checks for the presence of unused classical registers, and fails with an error if there\nare any. Qiskit on IQM is an open source Python project.\nYou can contribute by creating GitHub issues to report bugs or request new features,\nor by opening a pull request to submit your own improvements to the codebase. To start developing the project, clone the GitHub repository and install it in editable mode with all the extras: To be able to build the docs graphviz has to be installed.\nThen to build and view the docs run: Format your code: Run the tests: After implementing changes to Qiskit on IQM one usually wants to release a new version. This means\nthat after the changes are merged to the main branch the repository should have an updated CHANGELOG.rst with information about the new changes, the latest commit should be tagged with the new version number, and a release should be created based on that tag. The last two steps are automated, so one needs to worry only about properly updating the CHANGELOG.\nIt should be done along with the pull request which is introducing the main changes. The new version\nmust be added on top of all existing versions and the title must be \u201cVersion MAJOR.MINOR\u201d, where MAJOR.MINOR\nrepresents the new version number. Please take a look at already existing versions and format the rest of\nyour new CHANGELOG section similarly. Once the pull request is merged into main, a new tag and a release will\nbe created automatically based on the latest version definition in the CHANGELOG. previous Qiskit on IQM next API Reference By Qiskit on IQM developers \u00a9 Copyright 2022-2024, Qiskit on IQM developers."

    "content": "Bases: object Unique key associated with a measurement instruction. Qiskit stores the results of quantum measurements in classical registers consisting of bits.\nThe circuit execution results are presented as bitstrings of a certain structure so that the classical\nregister and the index within that register for each bit is implied from its position in the bitstring. For example, if you have two classical registers in the circuit with lengths 3 and 2, then the\nmeasurement results will look like \u201801 101\u2019 if the classical register of length 3 was added to\nthe circuit first, and \u2018101 01\u2019 otherwise. If a bit in a classical register is not used in any\nmeasurement operation it will still show up in the results with the default value of \u20180\u2019. To be able to handle measurement results in a Qiskit-friendly way, we need to keep around some\ninformation about how the circuit was constructed. This can, for example, be achieved by keeping\naround the original Qiskit quantum circuit and using it when constructing the results in IQMJob . This should be done so that the circuit is saved on the server side and not in IQMJob , since otherwise users will not be able to retrieve results from a detached Python\nenvironment solely based on the job id. Another option is to use measurement key strings to\nstore the required info. Qiskit does not use measurement keys, so we are free to use them\ninternally in the communication with the IQM server, and can encode the necessary information in\nthem.

None Serialize a quantum circuit into the IQM data transfer format. Serializing is not strictly bound to the native gateset, i.e. some gates that are not explicitly mentioned in\nthe native gateset of the backend can still be serialized. For example, the native single qubit gate for IQM\nbackend is the \u2018r\u2019 gate, however \u2018x\u2019, \u2018rx\u2019, \u2018y\u2019 and \u2018ry\u2019 gates can also be serialized since they are just\nparticular cases of the \u2018r\u2019 gate. If the circuit was transpiled against a backend using Qiskit\u2019s transpiler\nmachinery, these gates are not supposed to be present. However, when constructing circuits manually and\nsubmitting directly to the backend, it is sometimes more explicit and understandable to use these concrete\ngates rather than \u2018r\u2019. Serializing them explicitly makes it possible for the backend to accept such circuits. Qiskit uses one measurement instruction per qubit (i.e. there is no measurement grouping concept). While\nserializing we do not group any measurements together but rather associate a unique measurement key with each\nmeasurement instruction, so that the results can later be reconstructed correctly (see MeasurementKey documentation for more details). circuit ( QuantumCircuit ) \u2013 quantum circuit to serialize qubit_mapping ( dict [ int , str ] | None ) \u2013 Mapping from qubit indices in the circuit to qubit names on the device.

    "content": "This guide serves as an introduction to the main features of Cirq on IQM. You are encouraged to run the demonstrated\ncode snippets and check the output yourself. The recommended way is to install the distribution package cirq-iqm directly from the Python Package Index (PyPI): After installation Cirq on IQM can be imported in your Python code as follows: Cirq on IQM provides descriptions of IQM\u2019s quantum architectures using the IQMDevice class, which is a\nsubclass of cirq.devices.Device and implements general functionality relevant to all IQM devices. The native\ngates and connectivity of the architecture are available in the IQMDeviceMetadata object returned by the IQMDevice.metadata property. It is possible to use the IQMDevice class directly, but\ncertain devices with predefined metadata are also available as subclasses of IQMDevice. As an example, let\nus import the class Adonis , which describes IQM\u2019s five-qubit architecture, and view some of its\nproperties contained in its metadata property: IQM devices use cirq.NamedQubit to represent their qubits. The names of the qubits consist of a prefix\nfollowed by a numeric index, so we have qubit names like QB1 , QB2 , etc. Note that we use 1-based\nindexing. You can get the list of the qubits in a particular device by accessing the qubits attribute of a\ncorresponding IQMDevice instance: There are two main ways of constructing cirq.Circuit instances for IQM devices: Create a Circuit instance using arbitrary qubit names and types. Create a Circuit from an OpenQASM 2.0 program. The qubit names are determined by the OpenQASM qreg names,\nappended with zero-based indices. Below we give an example of each method. Construct a circuit and use arbitrary qubits: This will result in the circuit You can read an OpenQASM 2.0 program from a file (or a string), e.g. and convert it into a cirq.Circuit object using circuit_from_qasm() . circuit_from_qasm() uses the OpenQASM 2.0 parser in cirq.contrib.qasm_import . After a circuit has been constructed, it can be decomposed and routed against a particular IQMDevice . The method IQMDevice.decompose_circuit() accepts a cirq.Circuit object as an argument and\nreturns the decomposed circuit containing only native operations for the corresponding device: The Hadamard and CNOT gates are not native to Adonis, so they were decomposed to X, Y and CZ gates which are. Routing means transforming a circuit such that it acts on the device qubits, and respects the\ndevice connectivity.\nThe method IQMDevice.route_circuit() accepts a cirq.Circuit object as an argument,\nand returns the circuit routed against the device, acting on the device qubits instead of the\narbitrary qubits we had originally. Along with the routed circuit route_circuit() returns the initial_mapping and final_mapping .\nThe initial_mapping is either the mapping from circuit to device qubits as provided by an cirq.AbstractInitialMapper or a mapping that is initialized from the device graph.\nThe final_mapping is the mapping from physical qubits before inserting SWAP gates to the physical\nqubits after the routing is complete As mentioned above, you may also provide the initial mapping from the logical qubits in the circuit to the physical qubits on the device yourself, by using the keyword argument initial_mapper .\nIt serves as the starting point of the routing: Under the hood, route_circuit() leverages the routing provided by cirq.RouteCQC .\nIt works on single- and two-qubit gates, and measurement operations of arbitrary size.\nIf you have gates involving more than two qubits you need to decompose them before routing.\nSince routing may add some SWAP gates to the circuit, you will need to decompose the circuit\nagain after the routing, unless SWAP is a native gate for the target device. To ensure that the transpiler is restricted to a specific subset of qubits, you can provide a list\nof qubits in the qubit_subset argument such that ancillary qubits will not be added during\nrouting. This is particularly useful when running Quantum Volume benchmarks. Devices that have the IQM Star architecture (e.g. IQM Deneb) contain\ncomputational resonators in addition to qubits, and use qubit-resonator gates instead of two-qubit\ngates. These include the MOVE gate which moves qubit states to and from the resonators.\nThere are two main supported workflows for the Star architecture: Construct your circuit as you would for a regular qubits-only device, decompose (and optimize)\nit to native gates, and then route it using IQMDevice.route_circuit() .\nThis will attempt to route all the (fictional) two-qubit gates in the circuit through the\nresonator(s) using the native gates, adding MOVE gates as necessary.\nUnder the hood, this uses the transpile_insert_moves() function of the iqm_client library. Construct your circuit directly using the device qubits, resonators, and qubit-resonator gates,\nrouting it manually. Advanced users can use transpile_insert_moves_into_circuit() to transpile circuits that\nhave some MOVE gates in them in addition to fictional qubit-qubit gates. Yet another important topic is circuit optimization. In addition to the optimizers available in Cirq you can also\nbenefit from Cirq on IQM\u2019s optimizers module which contains some optimization tools geared towards IQM devices.\nThe function optimizers.simplify_circuit() is a convenience method encapsulating a particular sequence of\noptimizations. Let us try it out on our decomposed and routed circuit above: Note The funtion simplify_circuit() is not associated with any IQM device, so its result may contain non-native\ngates for a particular device. In the example above we don\u2019t have them, however it is generally a good idea to run\ndecomposition once again after the simplification. Note You can access IQM quantum computers via IQM Resonance or use one of the IQM quantum computers deployed at HPC centers and research institutions around the globe. Cirq contains various simulators which you can use to simulate the circuits constructed above.\nIn this subsection we demonstrate how to run them on an IQM quantum computer. Cirq on IQM provides IQMSampler , a subclass of cirq.work.Sampler , which is used\nto execute quantum circuits and decompose/route them for the architecture of the quantum computer.\nOnce you have access to an IQM server you can create an IQMSampler instance and use its run() method to send a circuit for execution and retrieve the results: Note that the code snippet above assumes that you have set the variable iqm_server_url to the URL\nof the IQM server. Additionally, you can pass IQM backend specific options to the IQMSampler class.\nThe below table summarises the currently available options: Name Type Example value Description calibration_set_id uuid.UUID \u201cf7d9642e-b0ca-4f2d-af2a-30195bd7a76d\u201d Indicates the calibration set to use. Defaults to None , which means the IQM server will use the\ncurrent default calibration set automatically. compiler_options CircuitCompilationOptions see below Contains various options that affect the compilation of the quantum circuit into an\ninstruction schedule. The CircuitCompilationOptions class contains the following attributes (in addition to some\nadvanced options described in the API documentation): Name Type Example value Description max_circuit_duration_over_t2 float | None 1.0 Set server-side circuit disqualification threshold. If any circuit in a job is estimated to take longer than the\nshortest T2 time of any qubit used in the circuit multiplied by this value, the server will reject the job.\nSetting this value to 0.0 will disable circuit duration check.\nThe default value None means the server default value will be used. heralding_mode HeraldingMode \u201czeros\u201d Heralding mode to use during execution. The default value is \u201cnone\u201d, \u201czeros\u201d enables\nall-zeros heralding where the circuit qubits are measured before the circuit begins, and the\nserver post-selects and returns only those shots where the heralding measurement yields zeros\nfor all the qubits. For example if you would like to use a particular calibration set, you can provide it as follows: The sampler will by default use an IQMDevice created based on architecture data obtained\nfrom the server, which is then available in the IQMSampler.device property. The architecture\ndata depends on the calibration set used by the sampler, so one should usually use different sampler\ninstances for different calibration sets. Alternatively, the device can be specified directly with\nthe device argument, but this is not recommended when running on a real quantum computer. When executing a circuit that uses something other than the device qubits, you need to route it first,\nas explained in the Routing section above. If you are using IQM Resonance, you have two options to authenticate: Set the IQM_TOKEN environment variable with the API token obtained from the Resonance dashboard. Pass the token parameter to IQMSampler . This will be forwarded to IQMClient . If the IQM server you are connecting to requires authentication, you may use Cortex CLI to retrieve and automatically refresh access tokens,\nthen set the IQM_TOKENS_FILE environment variable, as instructed, to point to the tokens file.\nSee Cortex CLI\u2019s documentation for details. Alternatively, you may authenticate yourself using the IQM_AUTH_SERVER , IQM_AUTH_USERNAME and IQM_AUTH_PASSWORD environment variables, or pass them as\narguments to IQMSampler , but this approach is less secure and\nconsidered deprecated. Multiple circuits can be submitted to the IQM quantum computer at once using the run_iqm_batch() method of IQMSampler .  This is often faster than\nexecuting the circuits individually. Circuits submitted in a batch are still executed sequentially. It is possible to inspect the final circuits that would be submitted for execution before actually submitting them,\nwhich can be useful for debugging purposes. This can be done using IQMSampler.create_run_request() , which returns\na RunRequest containing the circuits and other data. The method accepts the same\nparameters as IQMSampler.run() and IQMSampler.run_iqm_batch() , and creates the run request in the same\nway as those functions. It is also possible to print a run request when it is actually submitted by setting the environment variable IQM_CLIENT_DEBUG=1 . More examples are available in the examples directory of the Cirq on IQM repository. Cirq on IQM is an open source Python project.\nYou can contribute by creating GitHub issues to report bugs or request new features,\nor by opening a pull request to submit your own improvements to the codebase. To start developing the project, clone the GitHub repository and install it in editable mode with all the extras: Build and view the docs: Run the tests: After implementing changes to Cirq on IQM one usually wants to release a new version. This means\nthat after the changes are merged to the main branch - the repository should have an updated CHANGELOG with information about the new changes, the latest commit should be tagged with the new version number, and a release should be created based on that tag. The last two steps are automated, so one needs to worry only about properly updating the CHANGELOG.\nIt should be done along with the pull request which is introducing the main changes. The new version\nmust be added on top of all existing versions and the title must be \u201cVersion MAJOR.MINOR\u201d, where MAJOR.MINOR\nrepresents the new version number. Please take a look at already existing versions and format the rest of\nyour new CHANGELOG section similarly. Once the pull request is merged into main, a new tag and a release will\nbe created automatically based on the latest version definition in the CHANGELOG. previous Cirq on IQM next API Reference By Cirq on IQM developers \u00a9 Copyright 2020\u20132024, Cirq on IQM developers.

    "content": "IQM client is designed to be the Python adapter to IQM\u2019s quantum computers for application-level\nquantum computing frameworks.  For example integrations maintained by IQM, please refer to the Qiskit and Cirq packages. IQM client offers the functionality to submit quantum circuits to an IQM quantum computer, query a\njob or a job status, and retrieve the quantum architecture of the quantum computer. The following sections illustrate how to integrate IQM quantum computers into your quantum computing\nframework. Initialising the IQM client is simple, and in case you perform authentication as described below,\nrequires only the URL of the IQM quantum computer. To submit a quantum circuit for execution, it has to be specified using the Circuit class.\nThe available native instructions are documented in the Instruction class. Then the circuit can be submitted, and its status and result can be queried with the job id. A dict containing arbitrary metadata can be attached to the circuit before submitting it for\nexecution. The attached metadata should consist only of values of JSON serializable datatypes.\nA utility function to_json_dict() can be used to convert supported datatypes,\ne.g. numpy.ndarray , to equivalent JSON serializable types. The progress of the job can be followed with IQMClient.get_run_status() . Once the job is ready,\nthe results can be read with IQMClient.get_run() . Both of these actions are combined in IQMClient.wait_for_results() which waits until the job is ready and then returns the result. In addition to the actual results, job result contains also metadata of the job execution.\nThe metadata includes the original request, ID of the calibration set used in the execution, and\na collection of timestamps describing the duration of the execution. The timestamps returned with job results are stored as an optional dict called timestamps in the metadata of RunResult of the job. Each timestamp is stored in the dict with a key describing the point in job processing where\nthe timestamp was stored. For example, the timestamp stored at the start of circuit compilation step is stored with\nkey compile_start . Other timestamps are stored in the same way, with keys containing the step name, compile , submit or execution , and either a _start or _end suffix. In addition, there are\nalso timestamps for starting and ending the job itself, job_start and job_end . If the job processing is\nterminated before it is complete the timestamps of steps not processed will not be present in the dict. The first timestamp stored is the job_start timestamp. It is stored when the server receives the job request. The job processing starts with compilation step where the circuits are converted to pulse schedules that can be\nsent for execution. Compilation step produces timestamps compile_start and compile_end . The pulse schedules are then submitted for execution. This step produces timestamps submit_start and submit_end . After submitting the pulse schedules the server waits for the execution results.\nThis step produces timestamps execution_start and execution_end . Finally, when job processing is complete, regardless whether the job was successful or not, the timestamp job_end is stored. IQM uses bearer token authentication to manage access to quantum computers.\nCurrently, there are three mutually exclusive ways of providing an authentication\ntoken to IQM client: The recommended way is to use Cortex CLI to manage the authentication tokens and store them into a file. IQM client can then read\nthe token from the file and use it for authentication. The file path can be provided to\nIQM client in environment variable IQM_TOKENS_FILE .\nAlternatively, the tokens file path can be provided as argument tokens_file to IQMClient constructor. It is also possible to use plaintext token obtained from a server dashboard. These\ntokens may have longer lifespan than access tokens generated by Cortex CLI, and thus\nIQM client won\u2019t attempt to refresh them. The generated token can be provided to IQM\nclient in environment variable IQM_TOKEN .\nAlternatively, the token can be provided as argument token to IQMClient constructor. The third way is to provide server URL, username and password for obtaining the\ntoken from an authentication server. IQM client will maintain a login session with\nthe authentication server and read and refresh the token as needed. The server URL,\nusername and password can be provided to IQM client in environment variables IQM_AUTH_SERVER , IQM_AUTH_USERNAME and IQM_AUTH_PASSWORD .\nAlternatively, the values can be provided as arguments auth_server_url , username and password to IQMClient constructor.\nNote, that all the values must be provided as either environment variables or\nas constructor arguments, not mixed. IQM does not provide an open source circuit transpilation library, so this will have to be supplied\nby the quantum computing framework or a third party library.  To obtain the necessary information\nfor circuit transpilation, IQMClient.get_dynamic_quantum_architecture() returns the names of the\nQPU components (qubits and computational resonators), and the native operations available\nin the given calibration set. This information should enable circuit transpilation for the\nIQM Crystal quantum architectures. The notable exception is the transpilation for the IQM Star quantum architectures, which have\ncomputational resonators in addition to qubits. Some specialized transpilation logic involving\nthe MOVE gates specific to these architectures is provided, in the form of the fuctions transpile_insert_moves() and transpile_remove_moves() .\nSee iqm.iqm_client.transpile for the details. A typical Star architecture use case would look something like this: We encourage to transpile circuits to use the physical IQM qubit names before submitting them to IQM\nquantum computers.  In case the quantum computing framework does not allow for this, providing a\nqubit mapping can do the translation from the framework qubit names to IQM qubit names.  Note, that\nqubit mapping is not supposed to be associated with individual circuits, but rather with the entire\njob request to IQM server.  Typically, you would have some local representation of the QPU and\ntranspile the circuits against that representation, then use qubit mapping along with the generated\ncircuits to map from the local representation to the IQM representation of qubit names.  We\ndiscourage exposing this feature to end users of the quantum computing framework. Before performing circuit execution, IQM server checks how long it would take to run each circuit.\nIf any circuit in a job would take too long to execute compared to the T2 time of the qubits,\nthe server will disqualify the job, not execute any circuits, and return a detailed error message.\nIn some special cases, it makes sense to adjust or disable this check using\nthe max_circuit_duration_over_t2 attribute of CircuitCompilationOptions ,\nand then passing the options to IQMClient.submit_circuits() . Set IQM_CLIENT_REQUESTS_TIMEOUT environment variable to override the network requests default\ntimeout value. The default value is 60 seconds and might not be sufficient when fetching run results\nof larger circuits via slow network connections. On Linux: On Windows: Once set, this environment variable will control network request timeouts for IQMClient methods abort_job , get_quantum_architecture , get_dynamic_quantum_architecture , get_run , and get_run_status . Set IQM_CLIENT_SECONDS_BETWEEN_CALLS to control the polling frequency when waiting for\ncompilation and run results with the IQMClient.wait_for_compilation() and IQMClient.wait_for_results() methods. The default value is set to 1 second. Set IQM_CLIENT_DEBUG=1 to print the run request when it is submitted for execution in IQMClient.submit_circuits() or IQMClient.submit_run_request() . To inspect the run request without sending\nit for execution, use IQMClient.create_run_request() . IQM provides a demo environment to test the integration against a mock quantum computer. If you\u2019d\nlike to request access to that environment, please contact IQM . previous iqm.iqm_client.util.IQMJSONEncoder next License By IQM client developers \u00a9 Copyright 2021-2024, IQM.

For executing code on an IQM quantum computer,\nyou can use for example the Qiskit on IQM library. If you want just this library, though, you can install it from the Python Package Index (PyPI), e.g.: Note uv is highly recommended for practical Python environment and package management. Supplied within the Python package there is an additional requirements.txt file containing locked, security scanned\ndependencies. The file can be used to constrain installed dependencies either directly from the repo or by\nextracting it from the PyPI package. Format your code: Run the tests: Update the requirements: After this, any changes in the lockfile requirements.txt have to be committed.\nThe script upgrades locked dependencies defined in pyproject.toml within the given version ranges. However, transitive\ndependencies are deliberately not upgraded automatically. Documentation for the latest version is available online .\nYou can build documentation for any older version locally by cloning the Git repository, checking out the\ncorresponding tag, and running the docs builder. For example, to build the documentation for version 20.12 : (Unless you need to build documentation for multiple versions, consider passing git clone options to\nonly clone the commit for the specific version tag, e.g. --branch 15.4 --depth 1 for version 15.4 .\nThis will be much faster than cloning the full repository, because some large files have been stored\nin the commit history.) ./docbuild will build the documentation at ./build/sphinx/html . This command requires the sphinx and sphinx-book-theme Python packages (see the docs optional dependency in pyproject.toml );\nyou can install the necessary packages with e.g. uv pip install -e \".[dev,docs]\" IQM client is free software, released under the Apache License, version 2.0.

    "content": "Transpiling circuits to IQM devices involving computational resonators. In the IQM Star architecture, computational resonators are connected to multiple qubits.\nA MOVE gate can be used to move the state of a qubit to a connected, empty computational resonator,\nand back to the same qubit . Additionally, two-component gates like CZ can be applied\nbetween a qubit and a connected resonator, so that effectively the qubit can be made to interact\nwith other qubits connected to the resonator. However, the resonators cannot be measured,\nand no single-qubit gates can be applied on them. To enable third-party transpilers to work on the IQM Star architecture, we may abstract away the\nresonators and replace the real dynamic quantum architecture with a simplified architecture .\nSpecifically, this happens by removing the resonators from the architecture, and for\neach resonator r , and for each pair of supported native qubit-resonator (QR) gates (G(q1, r), MOVE(q2, r)) adding the fictional gate G(q1, q2) to the simplified architecture.\nThis works since the fictional gate can be implemented as the QR gate sequence This sequence is called a resolution of G(q1, q2) .\nCurrently  we assume all the QR gates (other than MOVE) are symmetric in the sense that holds. This has the effect of doubling the number of possible resolutions for G(q1, q2) since\nyou can reverse the roles of the qubits. Before a circuit transpiled to a simplified architecture can be executed it must be further\ntranspiled to the real Star architecture using transpile_insert_moves() , which will introduce\nthe resonators, add MOVE gates as necessary to move the states, and convert the fictional two-qubit\ngates into real native gates acting on qubit-resonator pairs. Likewise transpile_remove_moves() can be used to perform the opposite transformation,\nconverting a circuit valid for the real Star architecture into an equivalent circuit for the\ncorresponding simplified architecture, e.g. so that the circuit can be retranspiled or optimized\nusing third-party tools that do not support the MOVE gate. Given a DynamicQuantumArchitecture for a Star architecture, the corresponding simplified\nversion can be obtained using simplify_architecture() . Module Attributes Resolution A (gate qubit, move qubit, resonator) triple that represents a resolution of a fictional qubit-qubit gate.

This class represents a native quantum operation\nacting on qubits , with the arguments args .\nThe operation is determined by name . We currently support the following native operations: name # of qubits args description measure >= 1 key: str , feedback_key: str Measurement in the Z basis. prx 1 angle_t: float , phase_t: float Phased x-rotation gate. cc_prx 1 angle_t: float , phase_t: float , feedback_qubit: str , feedback_key: str Classically controlled PRX gate. cz 2 Controlled-Z gate. move 2 Moves a qubit state between a qubit and a\ncomputational resonator, as long as\nat least one of the components is\nin the \\(|0\\rangle\\) state. barrier >= 1 Execution barrier. delay >= 1 duration: float Force a delay between circuit operations. For each Instruction you may also optionally specify implementation ,\nwhich contains the name of an implementation of the operation to use.\nSupport for multiple implementations is currently experimental and in normal use the\nfield should be omitted, this selects the default implementation for the operation for that locus. Measurement in the computational (Z) basis. The measurement results are the output of the circuit.\nTakes two string arguments: key , denoting the measurement key the returned results are labeled with,\nand feedback_key , which is only needed if the measurement result is used for classical control\nwithin the circuit.\nAll the measurement keys and feedback keys used in a circuit must be unique (but the two groups of\nkeys are independent namespaces).\nEach qubit may be measured multiple times, i.e. mid-circuit measurements are allowed. Phased x-rotation gate, i.e. an x-rotation conjugated by a z-rotation.\nTakes two arguments, the rotation angle angle_t and the phase angle phase_t ,\nboth measured in units of full turns ( \\(2\\pi\\) radians).\nThe gate is represented in the standard computational basis by the matrix where \\(\\theta\\) = angle_t , \\(\\phi\\) = phase_t ,\nand \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are Pauli matrices. Classically controlled PRX gate. Takes four arguments. angle_t and phase_t are exactly as in PRX. feedback_key is a string that identifies the measure instruction whose result controls\nthe gate (the one that shares the feedback key). feedback_qubit is the name of the physical qubit within the measure instruction that produces the feedback.\nIf the measurement result is 1, the PRX gate is applied. If it is 0, an identity gate of similar time\nduration gate is applied instead.\nThe measurement instruction must precede the classically controlled gate instruction in the quantum circuit. Controlled-Z gate. Represented in the standard computational basis by the matrix It is symmetric wrt. the qubits it\u2019s acting on, and takes no arguments. The MOVE operation is a unitary population exchange operation between a qubit and a resonator.\nIts effect is only defined in the invariant subspace \\(S = \\text{span}\\{|00\\rangle, |01\\rangle, |10\\rangle\\}\\) ,\nwhere it swaps the populations of the states \\(|01\\rangle\\) and \\(|10\\rangle\\) .\nIts effect on the orthogonal subspace is undefined. MOVE has the following presentation in the subspace \\(S\\) : where \\(a\\) is an undefined complex phase that is canceled when the MOVE gate is applied a second time. To ensure that the state of the qubit and resonator has no overlap with \\(|11\\rangle\\) , it is\nrecommended that no single qubit gates are applied to the qubit in between a\npair of MOVE operations. Note MOVE is only available in quantum computers with the IQM Star architecture. Affects the physical execution order of the instructions elsewhere in the\ncircuit that act on qubits spanned by the barrier.\nIt ensures that any such instructions that succeed the barrier are only executed after\nall such instructions that precede the barrier have been completed.\nHence it can be used to guarantee a specific causal order for the other instructions.\nIt takes no arguments, and has no other effect. Note One-qubit barriers will not have any effect on circuit\u2019s compilation and execution. Higher layers\nthat sit on top of IQM Client can make actual use of one-qubit barriers (e.g. during circuit optimization),\ntherefore having them is allowed. Forces a delay between the preceding and following circuit operations.\nIt can be applied to any number of qubits. Takes one argument, duration , which is the minimum\nduration of the delay in seconds. It will be rounded up to the nearest possible duration the\nhardware can handle. Note We can only guarantee that the delay is at least of the requested duration, due to both\nhardware and practical constraints, but could be much more depending on the other operations\nin the circuit. To see why, consider e.g. the circuit In this case the actual delay between the two CZ gates will be 100 ns rounded up to\nhardware granularity, even though only 1 ns was requested for alice .

Qubits on which dynamical decoupling should be applied. If None , all qubits are targeted. Skip processing leading Wait instructions. Skip processing trailing Wait instructions. Available decoupling gate sequences to chose from in this strategy. Each sequence is defined by a tuple of (ratio, gate pattern, align) : ratio: Minimal duration for the sequence (in PRX gate durations) as integer. gate pattern: Gate pattern can be defined in two ways. It can be a string containing \u201cX\u201d and \u201cY\u201d characters,\nencoding a PRX gate sequence. For example, \u201cYXYX\u201d corresponds to the\nXY4 sequence, \u201cXYXYYXYX\u201d to the EDD sequence, etc. If more flexibility is needed, a gate pattern can be\ndefined as a sequence of PRX gate argument tuples (that contain a rotation angle and a phase angle). For\nexample, sequence \u201cYX\u201d could be written as [(math.pi, math.pi / 2), (math.pi, 0)] . align: Controls the alignment of the sequence within the time window it is inserted in. Supported values: \u201casap\u201d: Corresponds to a ASAP-aligned sequence with no waiting time before the first pulse. \u201ccenter\u201d: Corresponds to a symmetric sequence. \u201calap\u201d: Corresponds to a ALAP-aligned sequence. The Dynamical Decoupling algorithm uses the best fitting gate sequence by first sorting them\nby ratio in descending order. Then the longest fitting pattern is determined by comparing ratio with the duration of the time window divided by the PRX gate duration.
