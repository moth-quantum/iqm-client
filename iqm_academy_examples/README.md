# IQM Academy Examples

This repository contains example notebooks demonstrating how to run quantum algorithms on IQM hardware using various access methods:

- Pulse-level access via IQM Pulla
- Gate-level access using quantum programming frameworks like:
    - qrisp
    - Qiskit
    - Cirq
    - And more

## Repository Structure

The examples are organized by access method and framework to help you find relevant examples for your use case.

## Prerequisites

These examples require the following packages:

- `iqm-pulla`: For pulse-level access to IQM quantum computers
- `iqm-client`: For gate-level access to IQM quantum computers
- Associated dependencies for each framework (e.g., `qrisp[iqm]`, `qiskit`, `cirq`)

## Getting Started

1. Browse the examples relevant to your preferred access method and framework

2. Install the required packages for each notebook, they are typically in the first cell.

3. Run the notebooks to see how to implement quantum algorithms on IQM hardware
