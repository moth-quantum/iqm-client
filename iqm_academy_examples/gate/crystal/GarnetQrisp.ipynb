    "# Executing a circuit using Qrisp on IQM Garnet\n",
    "\n",
    "Qrisp is a quantum programming language build around the concept of quantum variables. It is designed to be a high-level language that is easy to use and understand. Qrisp is a great tool for beginners to learn quantum computing and for experts to quickly prototype quantum algorithms. It offers a fresh take on quantum programming. You can learn more about Qrisp on the official website: [https://qrisp.eu/](https://qrisp.eu/).\n",
